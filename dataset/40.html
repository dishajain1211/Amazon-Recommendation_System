<h3 class="p4 h3head">PART <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></h3>

<p class="center muchlarger">Happiness as the Aim of Life.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <span class="title">Is a Guide to Happiness Possible? And, if
Possible, is it Desirable?</span></h3>

<p class="p2">The pursuit of happiness,&mdash;the pursuit of one’s own happiness,&mdash;is
it a vain quest? and, if not vain, is it a worthy
object of life?</p>

<p>There have been plenty to condemn it on both grounds.
They have said that the endeavor is hopeless; that to study
the art of being happy is like studying the art of making
gold, which is the only art by which gold can never be
made. Nothing, they add, is so unpropitious to happiness
as the very effort to attain it.</p>

<p>They go farther. “Let life,” they proclaim, “have a
larger purpose than enjoyment.” They quote the mighty
Plato, when he demands that the right aim of living shall
stand apart, and out of all relation to pleasure or pain.
They declare that the theory of happiness as an end is the
most dangerous of all in modern sociology&mdash;the tap-root
<!--014.png--><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 10</span>
of the worst weeds in the political theories of the day, for
the reason that the individual pursuit of enjoyment is necessarily
destructive of that of society at large. Moreover,
they urge, who dares write of it? For he who has not enjoyed
it, cannot speak wisely of it; and in him who has
attained it, ’twere insolence to boast of it.</p>

<p>Over against these stands another school, not, by any
means, solely a modern school. If that boasts Plato as its
leader, this can claim Aristotle as its master. It is
with the single aim to become happier, said that wise
teacher, that we deliberately perform any act of our lives.
This is the final end of every conscious action of man. That
alone is the true purpose of existence, which, by itself, and
not as a means to something else, makes life worth living
and desirable for its own sake; and happiness&mdash;happiness
alone&mdash;fulfills this requirement.</p>

<p>Through the ages this conflict has continued. We find
the thoughtful Pascal declaring that every free act of the
will has, and can have, no other end in view than the increase
of the individual happiness, be it so seemingly
inconsistent as drowning or hanging oneself; while the
distinctively modern school of social philosophers, without
any exception, pin to their banners the maxim of their
master, Jeremy Bentham, “The common end of every
person’s efforts is happiness;” and they love to confound
the ascetics by proclaiming, with Spencer, that “Without
pleasure there is no good in life;” or asserting, with Ward,
that the sole aim of a right sociology is the organization
<!--015.png--><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 11</span>
of happiness. Nay, they have gone so far as to project
a series of sciences by which the human race is to
reach a condition of entire enjoyment. They give us
“Eudæmonics,” or the art of the attainment of well-being;
“Hedonism,” or the theory of the securing of
pleasure; and even the “Hedonical Calculus,” by which
we can to a nicety calculate how much any object, if
secured, will add to our felicity.</p>

<p>These excellent authorities have therefore answered the
inquiry whether the pursuit of happiness is a possible occupation,
by showing that in fact we cannot of our own wills
do anything else; and though we often pursue it blindly
and by false routes, we can, by taking thought and learning
of others, follow it up successfully. So also taught
Aristotle, who tells us in his <cite>Ethics</cite>, “It is possible for
every man by certain studies and appropriate care to reach
a condition of happiness.”</p>

<p>Since the aim of enjoyment is thus natural, even thus
necessary, to man, since it is the motive of his every action,
how important that it should be guided by the dictates
of wisdom, and not condemned and discarded as evil!
Have not those who declared it criminal smothered the
germ which they should have nursed?</p>

<p>Away with the cold and cruel doctrines which for ages
have darkened the lives of men by teaching them that
enjoyment is folly and pleasure a sin! If the reasoned
pursuit of happiness conflicts with current morality, so
much the worse for that morality. Away with it, and in
<!--016.png--><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 12</span>
the light of a younger day seek a better one. What is
right is reasonable, and what is reasonable is right. Enjoy
yourself; it is the highest wisdom. Diffuse enjoyment;
it is the loftiest virtue. Not only are the two compatible;
they are inseparable; as the sage Rasselas said to the
Princess: “It is our business to consider what beings
like us may perform; each laboring for his own happiness
by promoting within his circle, however narrow, the happiness
of others.”</p>

<p>All agree that we should strive for the happiness of
others; it has even been said that this is the only moral
justification of any act of our lives. But the cup which
we are to proffer to all, we are, forsooth, forbidden to taste
ourselves! What is good for everybody else is bad for
oneself!</p>

<p>There is something radically wrong here, both in fact
and logic. Mental moods are contagious, and the man
who enjoys little will prove a kill-joy to others. Who are
more disagreeable than those Philistines and Pharisees who
insist on making you happy against your will, and contrary
to your inclinations? I have noticed that the usual
pretext for annoying people is solicitude about their
welfare. But, as a rule, people are not happy whose
pleasures are assigned them by others. Nobody’s vegetables
are so sweet as those from my own garden, and if
the whole world set to work to please me, I am sure I
should be discontented. These moralists put the cart
before the horse. Before we are qualified to make others
<!--017.png--><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 13</span>
happy we must compass happiness in some degree for
ourselves; and our success with others will be just to that
degree and no more. The quality and intensity of enjoyment
which we ourselves have is alone that which we are
able to impart to others. To assert, therefore, that we
should make no effort to obtain or increase this, is as
illogical as can be.</p>

<p>Here some one may think I am caught in my own trap.
For if people cannot assign pleasures to others, is it not an
impertinence to offer instruction on the subject? Can anybody
tell me better than myself what I like and what I
desire?</p>

<p>True, but the difference is wide between telling me
what things should please me, and telling me how I can
best please myself; and the latter is the aim of right
instruction in this matter. That it is badly needed, one
who runs may read. Most people pursue unhappiness
more steadily than happiness. Only fools find life an easy
thing; to the wise it is a perpetual surprise that they get
along at all. To them, life is a lesson to be learned, and
happiness is a science the first axiom in which is to seek
knowledge. To be happy one must work for it, and not
merely have the wish and possess the requisites; as Aristotle
so prettily expresses it, “As at the Olympic games, it is
not the strongest or handsomest who gain the crown, but
only those who join in the combat.”</p>

<p>There is boundless need for a clear statement of the true
theory of personal happiness. It has been neglected, misconceived,
<!--018.png--><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 14</span>
and decried long enough, and countless lives
have been darkened in consequence. Such a theory, to
be true, must be applicable to all men, of all sorts and
conditions, because the desire of happiness is the common
motive of all. Has it yet been discovered? That is the
object of the present inquiry&mdash;for it is little more than an
inquiry; but be sure that when it is discovered and set
forth, it will come not as something new or strange, but
like some half-forgotten, long familiar truth.</p>

<p>Not only, therefore, is it desirable, it is the bounden
duty of every man to consider his own highest happiness,
to learn what that is, and to go to work to secure it. It is
his duty to his neighbors as well as to himself; more
than that, it is his first duty to his kind. It is incumbent
on every generation to transmit an increased store of social
and personal felicity to posterity. This is the only good
reason for the continuance of the race. But a generation
does nothing except through its individual members;
hence, it all comes back to the personal effort for
happiness.</p>

<p>But the moralist will object, Is not this doctrine one
of absolute egotism, of stark selfishness?</p>

<p>This objection is what has nullified and cast into disfavor
every essay ever written, from the Nichomachean
Ethics downward, which attempted a reasoned and practical
art of increasing personal happiness. They have all
been frowned down as selfish and, therefore, immoral.</p>

<p>It is time for this opposition to cease. It rests on a
<!--019.png--><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 15</span>
misunderstanding of terms, on a confusion of different sensations,
on the bad books of some writers, but mostly on
ancient prejudice and an ignorance of facts. Let the subject
be approached with a mind free from bias; let the
false beacons hung out by some schools be disregarded;
above all, let a clear understanding of what happiness consists
in be gained; and this potent objection will be dismissed
from the case.</p>

<p>Let us turn, then, to the definition of happiness.</p>
</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <span class="title">The Definition of Happiness.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">In science a definition is not a resting-place, but a stepping-stone.
It is needless, therefore, to call the catalogue
of obsolete and obscure definitions of happiness. Some,
indeed, say that the definition, like the thing itself, is still
unfound.</p>

<p>I do not think this is so. Between the physiologists
and the psychologists, I believe we are in a position to
explain what happiness is; and if in parts the explanation
is a trifle subtle, it is not really obscure.</p>

<p>Happiness is not the same as pleasure, but it is generally
built upon or grows out of pleasurable feelings. We must
begin, therefore, our analysis with these, and with their
opposites&mdash;the painful feelings.</p>

<p>Pleasure and pain are both ultimate and undefinable experiences
of the mind. We cannot resolve them further;
but we can note certain unfailing relations they bear to the
<!--020.png--><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 16</span>
organism, which explain their significance. Pleasure characterizes
the normal and unimpeded exercise of physiological
functions of all kinds. There are as many elementary
pleasures as there are sensations. Pain is present only in
the reverse conditions. Modern physiologists have established,
therefore, the fundamental law, that pleasure connects
itself with vital energy, pain with its opposite; in
which they have not gone beyond, even if they have
caught up to, the maxim of Spinoza: “Pleasure is an
affection whereby the mind passes to a greater perfection;
pain is an affection whereby it passes to a lesser perfection.”</p>

<p>Such is the meaning of pleasure or of pleasurable feelings;
and there is no lack of writers, and weighty ones,
too, who maintain that happiness is merely the excess of
pleasure over pain; or the utmost pleasure we are capable
of; or the aggregate of continued pleasurable feelings.
All such phrases are wide of the mark. They confound
distinct things, and ignore the boundaries between the
different realms of mental action.</p>

<p>We must leave the physiologists and turn to profound
analysts of purely mental action, such as Hume and Kant,
for the right understanding of the meaning of happiness.
For these, its inseparable factors, are the Will and Self-consciousness.
As Kant expresses it,&mdash;“The Desire of
Happiness is the general title for all subjective motives of
the Will.” Desire is really stimulated, not by the image
of past pleasure, as Locke and his followers teach, but by
<!--021.png--><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 17</span>
the conception of Self. The satisfaction of desire is not
merely such, but is the satisfaction of the Self, in thus
reaching a greater perfection, to use Spinoza’s phrase.
Only by discriminating the object from the Self can the
pleasure of the subject become an end in itself. Hence
the real aim of the pleasure-seeker, though he is rarely
intellectually conscious of it, is to feel his own Self, his
own being, more keenly. Aristotle expressed this when
he wrote,&mdash;“Pleasure is the feeling which accompanies
Self-realization.”</p>

<p>To the extent, therefore, that pleasure develops the
sense of Self-consciousness it partakes of a higher nature
than mere sensation, which man shares in common with
the brutes; and to that extent it can claim the name of
Happiness, a feeling inseparable from free will and conscious
individuality. In man a true pleasure must always
be a pleasure in something else than the pleasure itself;
that is, it must heighten the sense of personal existence.</p>

<p>It is only the conception of Self as a permanent subject
to be pleased, that stimulates man to fresh endeavors, that
makes him seek knowledge and freedom, that lifts him
above the beast, contented with the satisfaction of its
appetites. This is what Fichte meant when he said that
the consciousness of Self alone enables us to understand
life and enjoy it. Nothing is truer than the motto, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Être
heureux, c’est vivre</i>,”&mdash;to be happy is to live.</p>

<p>Here, again, some uneasy moralist will point the finger
and raise the cry of “selfishness.” It is time to have
<!--022.png--><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 18</span>
done with this purblind, this high-gravel-blind moralist,
who refuses to distinguish between self-feeling and self-seeking.
There are two self-loves. The one is inseparable
from personal existence, the necessary point of departure
of every conscious action, whose activity and whose end
are alike in the object outside of the self; the other is that
egoism which directs both the action and its end toward
itself. The former is fecund, ennobling, inspiring; the
latter is sterile and enfeebling. Rightly understood, nothing
is so admirable as self-love; but love yourself, not for
what you are, but for what you may be. The wisest of
teachers set no higher mark for duty than, “Love thy
neighbor <em>as thyself</em>.” It was a modern and unphilosophical
derogation which substituted for it, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vivre pour
autrui</i>.” In living the best for ourselves, we live the best
for others.</p>

<p>The conclusion which we have now arrived at, that
happiness is the increasing consciousness of Self, leads us
to reflect whether this mental state is brought about solely
by what is generally known as “pleasures,” or whether
some other feeling, not usually classed as such, may not
have the same effect. Man can enjoy only through action,
and all his happiness depends on action; but there may be
a great deal and very intense activity in spheres of experience
to which the terms pleasure and pain, in their
physiological sense, do not apply. Indeed, such activities
may be present along with physical pain and mental suffering,
and yet the law hold good: that if these are of a
<!--023.png--><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 19</span>
nature to exalt the consciousness of self, they may be
a well-spring of happiness under circumstances the most
unfavorable. This explains a passage of Epictetus which I
thought over a long time before I mastered its significance,&mdash;“Happiness
is an <em>equivalent</em> for all troublesome things;”
not that it excludes or abolishes them, but that it is a
compensation for them. This puts the whole art of happiness
in a different light. It may teach us to avoid some
pains and troubles, and this is well; but the best of it
will ever be to give us an <em>equivalent</em> for the many that
remain. Any text-book of felicity which leaves this out of
account may as well be burned by Monsieur de Paris.</p>

<p>Now we can understand what Plato meant when he said
that the right aim of living should stand out of relation to
pleasure or pain. He had in mind these other activities
which give in some natures an intenser sense to self-consciousness
than any mere nerve reaction. The ancient
ideal was the greatness of the individual, the richness of
his imagination, the reach of his intellect, the strength of
his will, the firmness of his friendship, the devotion of his
patriotism, the singleness of his life and purpose in some
noble aim. This it was that floated before the intellectual
vision of Plato and led him to scorn the pleasures of the
sense and the charms of tranquillity.</p>

<p>Let us applaud him; for we moderns are not ignorant
of the luxury of toil and the joy of strong endeavor; we
too, like Othello, “do agnize an alacrity for hardness;”
with Seneca we can say, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Res severa est verum gaudium</i>.”
<!--024.png--><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 20</span>
But we hold it needless and unwise to leave any sunny
field uncultured on whose soil may be trained to bloom
the fragrant flower of pleasure.</p>

<p>The yearning for joy is a cry of nature which can never
be stifled. Give heed to it and obey it. It calls you to
wider horizons, to warmer sympathies, to a fuller growth,
to a completer development. It holds the secret of Evolution.
It is the incessant prompter to a higher form of
existence. Biologists have discovered that the avoidance
of painful and the search for pleasurable sensations are the
first principles of organic animal life, and are those which
have developed the amœba into the man. In him, this
general consciousness has blossomed into Self-consciousness,
and to this he owes all the growth of his higher
nature, his essentially human powers. To the extent that
this is brought into harmony with the sum of his faculties
and with his surroundings, he wins that something greater
than pleasure which we call happiness. From the culture
of this, if from any source, he must look for the advent of
those new spirit-powers which more fortunate generations
in the hereafter may enjoy. Who knows but those, our
dear children of after days, may gain a still higher form of
consciousness, one through which they will be brought into
harmony with the perfect working of the Cosmos, and
the ancient fable be realized, of men who walked the earth
as gods?</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <span class="title">The Relative Value of Pleasures.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">The learned have established what they call “a hierarchy
of the sciences,” a scheme which shows the relative
value and scope of the various departments of knowledge,
and how the one rises upon the other. So in the Science
of Happiness there is a series of degrees, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gradus ad
gaudium</i>, which measures the relative value of human
enjoyments and the dependence of the higher upon the
lower.</p>

<p>The ignorance or the disregard of this fact has led to
the ruin of more individual lives, and to more fatal
misfortunes to the race, than any other error whatsoever.
The poison of all false religions and philosophies lies
either in condemning pleasure or in commending low
forms of it; and the one is as hurtful as the other. The
religion which to-day numbers more believers than any
other, Buddhism, aims its loftiest aspirations to the extinction
of all desire and the abolition of all enjoyment.
These are the words of Buddha himself:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Let no man look for what is pleasant; for not to find
it is pain.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Let no man love anything; for the loss of the beloved
is sorrow.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“After pleasure follows grief, and from affection comes
fear.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I have run through many births, and painful it is to
be born again and again; but now, O Thou Builder of
<!--026.png--><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 22</span>
this house, Thou hast been seen, and not again shalt
Thou rebuild it. The mind has attained to the extinction
of all desire.”</p>

<p>This is the ideal of happiness that four hundred millions
of human beings hold before their minds to-day. If there
is any truth in the modern philosophy which teaches that
pleasure lies in functional activity, no more pernicious
message could be commended to mankind than that which
Buddha brought.</p>

<p>He is far from the only preacher of such a gospel.
“To rest in peace,” “to sleep in the Lord,”&mdash;is not
this the religious hope and aspiration of millions of
Christians? It is not a whit higher than the Nirvana
of the Buddhist.</p>

<p>The avoidance of pain is the lowest form of happiness;
more correctly, it is its mere negative, and scarcely deserves
to rank as one of its grades. Yet, alas! to how
many millions is it the highest form imagined! To how
many is the only escape from unhappiness to forget themselves!
This is the cause of that thirst for intoxicants and
narcotics which undermines and infects modern society.
Dr. Johnson would still find the multitude agree with him
in his opinion, that a man is never happy except when he
is drunk!</p>

<p>Those Quietists who preach tranquillity and contentment
as the goal which all should seek are but one step higher.
Indifference to pleasure, or a reduction of the number of
pleasures, is a sign of weakening of the reason and of a
<!--027.png--><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 23</span>
retrogression in development. No man has a right to be
happy because he is contented; though he may well be
contented because he is happy. To be “void of strong
desire,” set free from hope and fear, snugly harbored
from all storms of feeling, so far from being the condition
of the sage, is the aspiration of the fool. Keen sensations
awaken the sentiments, emotions fertilize the intellect,
passions educate the reason. The brute goes through life
without a smile or a tear; man’s proud privilege is to weep
and to laugh.</p>

<p>The ancients taught that philosophical happiness is to
want little, and that it is the error of the vulgar to want
much and to enjoy many things. The truer doctrine is
that happiness is expansion and growth, the enriching of
our natures by manifold experiences, and the securing this
by the multiplication of our desires. The avoidance of
pain and the limitation of our hopes to our powers are
sometimes valuable preliminaries to the pursuit of happiness,
but are not always essential to it, and in many instances
an over-solicitude about them destroys all chance
for a higher felicity. Happiness does not come of itself.
It has to be worked for, fought for; and courage and
endurance are as necessary in this as in any other struggle.
In the path of every pilgrim to the Celestial City stand
from time to time the giant figures of Death and Pain, and
shake their spears, saying, “Wilt thou dare?”</p>

<p>The sources of pleasure should, therefore, be multiplied
to the utmost, and they should be classified, so that undue
<!--028.png--><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 24</span>
value should not be assigned any one class. Theoretically,
there is nothing troublesome about this; practically, it is
often an insurmountable difficulty. The pleasures of the
senses are inferior to those of the emotions, and these in
turn are ranked by the enjoyments which pertain to the
exercise of the intellectual powers. No one of these can
wholly exclude the others. They are all inseparably united
in the individual entity; but the individual can enjoy
only with the faculties he possesses, and in proportion to
their relative strength. It is as absurd to ask more of him,
as it were to invite the gouty to a foot race, or the blind to
admire the colors in a painting.</p>

<p>It is well to establish and to recognize this hierarchy of
enjoyments, beginning with those of the sensations common
to animal life everywhere and culminating in those
of pure reason, whose crowning felicity is the pursuit
of truth; it has been done, and well done, by many
writers; but what has been generally overlooked is that
this scheme can have small practical application to the
conduct of life if it is not fully recognized that no one of
these roads to happiness can be successfully pursued while
the others are neglected, or branded with the sign, “Entrance
forbidden.”</p>

<p>This is where Asceticism has committed its fatal blunder,
and for thousands of years has made miserable the lives of
millions. Instead of self-control, it has demanded self-abnegation;
instead of the due and proportioned exercise
of all the powers, it has ordered the absolute disuse of some
<!--029.png--><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 25</span>
of them; quite as often of the highest as of the lowest, of
reason as often as lust. Under this baleful doctrine nations
have become misshapen in mind, atrophied in culture,
distorted from honest nature’s rule, mean, miserable, and
inefficient. Yet this same doctrine is preached to-day
from thousands of pulpits in lands of highest civilization.
Is it not time for the common sense of most to rise in protest
against such a survival from the Dark Ages of the life
of the race? Reason blushes only for pleasures which she
cannot explain, and he who acquaints himself with the
whole nature of man knows that all his powers and faculties
have their appropriate use. The ascetic may claim a
happiness all his own; but so do the extravagant and the
vicious; both stand condemned before the results of their
own successes.</p>

<p>The intellect has no right to chide the enjoyments of
the senses. Pleasures differ in degree and permanence, but
not in kind. <em>As pleasures</em> they are on a par, whether
derived from objects of sense, from the emotions, or from
the understanding. Such analysts of mind as Kant and
Epictetus agree that there is no <em>essential</em> distinction between
the most refined and the coarsest gratifications. “It
is one and the same vital force expressing itself in the Desires,
which is affected by all objects which cause Pleasure.”</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> <span class="title">The Distribution of Happiness.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">Having reached an understanding about what happiness
means, and some notion as to its various grades, it will
next be worth while to study its distribution in the several
classes of society, in contrasting grades of civilization, in
the two sexes, and at various ages. This will be dealing
with the subject according to the methods of natural
science, and it ought to lead to some interesting conclusions.</p>

<p>One might expect to find a general agreement as to the
main facts. Far from it. The common belief is that
happiness increases with the means, or at least with the
capacity, for happiness. It is this belief which inspires
men to labor for the means and improve their capacities.
But the philosophers nowise concede its correctness.
Hume argued that all who are happy are equally happy;
and Paley maintained that happiness is about equally
distributed among all orders of the community; that
the plowman gets as much real enjoyment out of life
as the philosopher, and the beggar at the gate as much
as the monarch on the throne. To which Dr. Johnson
replied that a small glass and a large one might be equally
full, but the latter holds more. The capacity, he justly
argued, of the philosopher to receive a multiplicity of
agreeable impressions is greater than that of the peasant,
and therefore, other things being equal, the quantity of
his enjoyment will be greater.</p>

<p><!--031.png--><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 27</span>
The learned Doctor, indeed, sometimes insisted that
felicity increases directly with the means of enjoyment.
Representing the latter by money, he would say that a man
with six thousand pounds a year should be ten times as
happy as the one with six hundred a year; and if he is
not, it is because he is an ass.</p>

<p>Here he was certainly wrong. Some of the main elements
of ordinary happiness are in the possession of every class
of society, high and low, poor and rich; such as the
means of self-preservation, family ties, friendship, amusement,
and repose. What wealth and power add to this
common stock becomes less and less at each remove.
This consideration led Bentham to question whether the
prince is twice as happy as the laborer, and to doubt
whether ten thousand times the wealth brings with it
twice the enjoyment. His followers have attempted to
frame the relation in a mathematical formula, and have
expressed it in the maxim, “The rate of increase of pleasure
decreases as its means increase.”</p>

<p>The conclusion is a satisfactory one for several reasons,
and appears to be borne out by the experience of mankind.
Gibbon quotes the saying of the potent Sultan
Abderrahman, who at the close of his brilliant reign of
forty years asserted that during the whole of that time he
had had but fourteen days of happiness; on which the
historian comments that he himself could claim many
more than the famous Prince.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is, that it is not the multiplication
<!--032.png--><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 28</span>
of the <em>means</em>, but of the <em>sources</em> of pleasure which is the
secret of happiness.</p>

<p>The extremes of the social conditions are almost equally
unfavorable, the one through the privations it entails, the
other through the burdens it imposes and the distractions it
brings. Both are unpropitious to self-culture, and this
alone lays substantial foundations for a considerable enjoyment
of life.</p>

<p>A similar debate has taken place in reference to the
distribution of happiness in the different grades of civilization.
Rousseau and his followers never tired of portraying
the delights of the savage state. Like the ancient Greeks,
he placed the Golden Age in some Arcadia of untutored
shepherds and lawless huntsmen. It is the fashion to smile
at his notion as the vagary of a crank; but the scientist of
our own day whose studies of the conditions of savage
tribes stand ahead of all others, has deliberately expressed
almost the same opinion as the result of his long researches.
“Civilization,” writes Dr. Theodore Waitz, “has proved
itself impotent to increase the sum of human enjoyment.”</p>

<p>What a sad conclusion to reach! And what a comment
on the jubilant shouts of those optimistic philosophers who
have been telling us how vastly better off we are than any
of our ancestors!</p>

<p>Yet these also are right in a certain sense. The most
careless reader of history must hug himself for joy to
think of the multitude of miseries and oppressions which
have disappeared from society in the last few centuries.
<!--033.png--><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 29</span>
The inquisition, slavery, trial by torture, the press gang,
are but a few of them. At that time the fate and the
happiness of the individual were in the hands of priests
and kings and nobles; now, thank Heaven! in most
countries, especially in our own, they are chiefly in the
control of the individual himself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is quite possible in a given state of
society that general evils may diminish while personal
suffering increases, owing to an undue exaltation of sensitiveness,
a sort of moral hyperesthesia, together with the
multiplication of desires beyond the means of satisfying
them. This is, in fact, the condition of modern society;
and these traits, together with its instability and rapid
changes, and the bitter competition instigated by its
enlarged freedom, have unquestionably very greatly diminished
the amount of happiness which might have been
expected from the ameliorations of the last few centuries.</p>

<p>There is but one remedy which will be of permanent
avail, and that is to educate the individual into some
other ideal of happiness than that which is filled by the
acquisition of property or the gratification of the senses.
The main purpose of all social institutions which have been
created up to the present time has been the getting and
the keeping of property; the motive of the higher civilization
which is to come will be the preparation of the
race for a life which will be filled and sustained by its
intellectual and spiritual contents.</p>

<p>The Greek philosopher thanked the gods especially for
<!--034.png--><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 30</span>
two blessings,&mdash;that they had created him a Greek and
not a barbarian, and a man and not a woman. Evidently
he held strongly to the opinion that in his own country,
at least, the men had the better part in life.</p>

<p>Though woman held an honorable position in Greek
society, it was inferior to what she enjoys in the United
States to-day; yet the philosopher, were he among us,
would probably repeat his thanks. It is quite certain
that in the distribution of happiness the stronger sex
has seized the lion’s share.</p>

<p>To be sure, there are certain advantages in the struggle
for life which a woman seems to be conceded, and others
which she by nature possesses. She is less exposed to
dangers than men; she escapes avocations of the greatest
hardship and risk; she is generally supported by the labor
of others, and she is allowed privileges in many small
matters of daily life which are denied the other sex. Of
her own nature she is less the slave of passion, less reckless,
less of an egotist, less inclined to deeds of violence
and crime. In all civilized countries the convictions of
women for criminal offenses are less than one-third those
of men.</p>

<p>These points are in favor of her securing a larger share
of happiness; but they are checked by many and serious
countervails. She is born an invalid. Her periodic sickness,
the burden of pregnancy, the pains of childbed, the
years of distress at her climacteric age, place her for the
best part of her life at a fearful disadvantage. Enter the
<!--035.png--><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 31</span>
library of a physician and turn the leaves of his thick
volumes on obstetrics and the diseases of women if you
would have your sympathies harrowed by a long list of
dreadful maladies of which men know nothing.</p>

<p>Another thought disables a woman, and must lessen and
darken the enjoyment of her life in every rank and condition
of society. Unless under immediate protection, she
is always exposed to the possibility of insult and assault,
and no general safeguards will ever entirely remove this
danger.</p>

<p>Outside of these inevitable disabilities, the unfortunate
elements in the modern condition of women are owing to
the legal and religious tyranny of men. The dogmas of
Christianity distinctly lowered her position compared to
what it was in the Roman Republic or the cities of
Etruria. At Delphi, the thoughts of the gods found
expression through the mouth of the priestess; but the
founder of Christian institutions forbade women to speak
in the churches. The ancient Greek prayed to the
goddesses, Minerva, Aphrodite, and Demeter, as the givers
of the good things of life, of wisdom, of love, and the
fruits of the field; but to the Christian, evil and death
and pain were what the first mother of the race brought
as a dower to her husband and left as a legacy to her
children.</p>

<p>These pernicious teachings led to a steady oppression of
woman in all ages of Christianity, our own included. So
<!--036.png--><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 32</span>
thoroughly did they become ingrained in the minds of
men that the most liberal scarcely recognized their presence.
The priest laid on the bride the obligation of
obedience to her husband; and the philosopher, Rousseau,
servile in this to the ideas of his time, when he has completed
the education of his Emile, contents himself with
saying to Sophie, “This is the man whom it is your duty <em>to
endeavor to please</em>!” Not until a man arose emancipated
from all tradition, did the teaching of Plato that the sexes
should be socially and politically equal find a modern philosopher
to echo it; that was when John Stuart Mill wrote
his essay on the freedom of woman; though it would be
unfair to the growth of religious thought not to add that
he had been anticipated in most practical points by the
despised dissenter, George Fox. Only when the spirit of
teachers such as these will have permeated the institutions,
the religions, and the social traditions of the day,
will women have a fair chance with men at the common
stock of happiness possible for the race.</p>

<p>Most fatal of all measures to the happiness of woman has
been the unceasing effort of ecclesiasticism to make marriage,
for her, an indissoluble sacrament of servitude, instead of
an equal civil contract, in which no obligation is assumed
on the one side which is not as fully accepted on the
other. Mill well remarks that the miseries produced in
the lives of individual women by subjection to individual
men are simply incalculable. Guarantee the wife every
<!--037.png--><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 33</span>
right and every privilege that the husband has, and the
increased happiness of both will be sure to crown the concession.</p>

<p>The remedy for this state of things is the proper education
of girls and women. But it is a remedy not likely to
be administered soon, in spite of the talk about it. Men
prefer ignorance in women, as women admire blind devotion
in men; because these enable each sex to cheat the
other more easily. Nothing is more essential to her
happiness than that she should be taught the hygiene of
her sex early in life; but the popular voice says ignorance
means innocence, and thousands of women are condemned
to life-long misery in consequence. I had a medical friend
who wrote a volume of excellent advice to mothers, and
his profession almost ostracized him for it. Beyond all
things, a girl’s education should be directed toward
manual training and exercises of the understanding;
instead of that, she is taught the fine arts and regaled
with poetry and fiction. Her imagination is fostered by
lectures on esthetics, and her memory crammed with
moral platitudes which have no place in real life; while
the principles of business and the maintenance of her own
rights are left out of her training. I cannot but attribute
to this the most common and fatal defect of the female
mind,&mdash;its lack of the sense of abstract justice.</p>

<p>Men are so selfish and ignorant that they do not understand
how much they themselves forfeit by thus reducing
the position of woman. In my studies of ethnology, I
<!--038.png--><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 34</span>
first inquire the position occupied by woman in a given
tribe or nation; for I have discovered no better common
measure of civilization. The profoundest thinkers of the
age have recognized the principle here involved. Goethe
closes the second part of Faust&mdash;which is a poetic presentation
of the evolution of European culture&mdash;with the significant
words,&mdash;“The forever feminine leads us onward.”
His friend, Wilhelm von Humboldt, expressed a double
fact in the phrase,&mdash;“The Woman stands nearer the ideal
of Humanity than the Man; but she more rarely attains
it.” She does not, because she is prevented by prejudice,
by dogmas, and by laws. Until these weeds are scorched
to ashes by the growing flame of free intelligence, neither
will she secure the meed of happiness which is her due,
nor will man have found the right road to his best prosperity.</p>

<p>Plato proposed to banish poets from his ideal Republic
because they are such liars. The prevalent notion that
childhood and youth are the happiest periods of life is
largely owing to this mendacious crew. I have rarely met
an intelligent person of years who held the opinion. It
arises from forgetfulness of early sorrows, from false pictures
of youthful joys, and from undue attention to present
pains. Most of those who really feel such regret are the
moral or literal prodigals, who have wasted their substance
in riotous living, and bewail, not the lost happiness, but
their inability to repeat their follies.</p>

<p>The rule of honest nature is that enjoyment should
<!--039.png--><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 35</span>
steadily increase up to the full maturity of the powers,
mental and physical. This, under favorable circumstances,
is between forty-five and fifty years of age. After that,
physical decadence sets in, and only by exceptional
strength or by increased effort can its fatal progress be for
a while stayed. From inquiry of many persons, I am persuaded
that the rule of the increase of enjoyment up to
this turning-point is on the average correct.</p>

<p>That old age is synonymous with wisdom is a comical
deception which the graybeards have palmed off on the
world, because by laws and customs they hold most of the
property, and want most of the power as well. In fact,
diminution of the physical powers means decay all round.
“As we grow old,” observes Thoreau, “we cease to obey
our finer instincts.” It is an error to talk of the accumulated
wisdom of years. The experience of youth serves
but to lead old age astray; and this is seen nowhere so
plainly as when an old man pretends a zest for the pleasures
of the young. “No fool like an old fool” is the
proverb. Such men are “out of their class,” as a trainer
of athletes would say. Every age has pleasures sufficient,
which are appropriate to it, and these alone should be
sought for. To those who know and respect these laws of
nature, old age is very tolerable. It brings many compensations
for its inevitable losses; and though not likely to be
so happy as the best of middle life, it should be and often
is superior in this respect to youth. Probably it would
generally be so were it more willing to learn the lessons appropriate
<!--040.png--><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 36</span>
to it. Bonstetten goes so far as to say, “No one
can be happy till he is past sixty;” but the proverb of the
ancient Rabbis holds forever good,&mdash;“He who teacheth
the old, is like one who writes on blotted paper.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> <span class="title">Principles of a Self-Education for the Promotion
of One’s Own Happiness.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">The purpose of this chapter is not to enter into practical
details of an education for happiness&mdash;that is the mission
of the rest of the book,&mdash;but to establish certain general
theoretical principles on which such an education must be
carried out in order to be successful.</p>

<p>And first, I must repeat what I have already intimated,
that any permanent and even moderate stock of happiness
does not fall into the open mouth, like the roasted quails
in the fairy story, but can be obtained only by methodical
pursuit and constant watchfulness. Eternal vigilance is
said to be the price of liberty; and liberty is only one of
the necessary elements of happiness. Meditation, forethought,
and the formation of a clearly defined Plan of
Life are all required, and even then success is far from
certain.</p>

<p>At the outset, I must attack as unsound a maxim which
has been assiduously disseminated by the school of economists
of which Herbert Spencer is the leader. It is put in
the form,&mdash;“The greatest efficiency is the greatest happiness.”
It would be a calamity if this were true. The
<!--041.png--><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 37</span>
pursuit of happiness would be hopelessly circumscribed, as
but few in the world can attain maximum efficiency in
anything. Fortunately, it is historically false. Those men
who have won fame by their enormous personal capacity
have certainly not been the happiest of their kind. Far
from it. They have been men of one idea, absorbed by
some “ruling passion,” to which they have sacrificed all
else, and consequently, so far from gaining happiness, have
usually ended by wrecking their own and others’. It is
not the reach of a man’s abilities, but the use he makes of
them, that decides his fortune. Spencer’s maxim is precisely
the reverse of the principle which should govern an
education intended to secure the utmost enjoyment for the
individual and those around him. Such an education
should not be concentrated on one faculty of the mind
nor on one subject of study, but should extend in all
directions, be broad and many-sided. It is an education
within the reach of every one, which requires no
schoolmaster but oneself; and yet confers a degree on
its graduates more valuable than any university can
bestow.</p>

<p>Its leading theoretical principles may be grouped under
five propositions:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> The multiplication of the sources of pleasure and the
diminution of those of pain.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> The maintenance of a high sensibility to pleasurable
impressions.</p>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> The search for novelty and variety of impressions.</p>

<p><!--042.png--><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 38</span>
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> The establishment of a proper relation between
desires and pleasures.</p>

<p><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> The subjection of all pleasures to the increase of
happiness.</p>

<p>These principles are not speculative or doctrinal, but
are based on the physiology of the nervous system and the
constitution of the human mind.</p>

<p><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Let us begin with the first, for it is the basis of the
whole Art of Pleasure. Differently expressed, it means
that the sum of our enjoyment must be enlarged by increasing
our sources of enjoyment. In other words, we must
set to work to acquire tastes in addition to those which we
already have by nature or previous education. The most
useful instruction is that which teaches us to profit by all
our chances. People are never so unhappy as they think
they are, because at the moment they forget how many
sources of pleasure remain for them.</p>

<p>Review the field. Take an “account of stock.”
Most people have five senses in tolerably good order. How
many have seriously calculated the number of different
gratifications each of these senses is capable of yielding?
Beyond these lie the inviting fields of the Agreeable Emotions,
whose prolific soil needs but to be stirred to teem
with flower and fruit; and still beyond, but in easy reach,
the uplands of Reason and Thought rise into the purer air,
and offer perspectives of entrancing beauty.</p>

<p>All these resources are, to some extent, open to every
one. But most sit like a peasant at the table of a prince,
<!--043.png--><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 39</span>
refusing to taste the choice viands which are before him,
because he cares only for the beans and hodge-podge of his
daily fare.</p>

<p>Along with the multiplication of the sources of enjoyment
must go the studied avoidance of profitless pain.
I say <em>profitless</em> pain, because there is pain which is profitable,
and to avoid that would be to miss the best of life,
as I shall try to show on a later page,&mdash;a distinction too
often forgotten by those political economists who are preparing
the race for the era of universal happiness.</p>

<p>All pain is profitless which is incurred by a deliberate
violation of natural law, such as needless neglect of health
or disregard of social custom. When we confess that we
have “made fools of ourselves,” we suffer what our knowledge
could have prevented, and we recognize it. The part
of wisdom is to avoid such suffering.</p>

<p>Here lies the incalculable value of knowledge in this
pursuit. I do not mean extensive learning or erudition,
but knowledge of ourselves, of our immediate natural surroundings,
and of our own sphere of probable activity.
The chief value of Knowledge, says Epictetus, is that it
destroys Fear. We do not dread the known, but the
unknown. Its worth does not stop there. It enables us
to escape disasters, to lessen pain, to mitigate suffering in
ourselves and others, and to secure many joys. Three
verbs, observes the philosophical Littré, express the ideal
perfection of human happiness&mdash;to know, to love, and to
serve.</p>

<p><!--044.png--><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 40</span>
The true end of what is called “culture,” or a “liberal
education,” is not to store the mind with a variety of facts
useful in managing men or in making money, but to
expand our sympathies, to bring us in touch with all that
is beautiful and enjoyable in our lives; it is to increase the
sensitiveness of our finer instincts, so that they will respond
more readily to the delicate stimuli of pleasurable impressions.
Thoreau, walking behind the farmer’s cart, claimed
to have stolen the best part of the load of apples when he
inhaled the fragrant aroma from the fruit. To him it was
more gratifying than to have filled his stomach with the
acid pippins.</p>

<p>Of all false maxims for happiness, that to be “content
with little” is the falsest. We should want immensely,
but want wisely. To supply such wants there is no need
of the revenue of a kingdom or the lore of a pedagogue.
Not one man in a thousand exhausts the means of wise
enjoyment which are daily within the reach of his hand.
Why go far a-field to seek the treasure buried neath his
own hearth-stone? What he needs is to study himself and
his environment, so as to protect himself from the dangers
to which he is exposed, and to draw from such circumstances
as he is placed in, and from such faculties as he is
possessed of, the maximum of gratification which they can
render him. If all persons acted consistently on this
principle, the general sum of human happiness would be
indefinitely increased.</p>

<p>The kind of knowledge which is most serviceable to this
<!--045.png--><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 41</span>
end is by no means difficult to acquire. It falls within
the range of a common school education, and ought to
be made a part of it, with the definite aim of promoting
personal happiness. Professor Alexander Bain, who
belongs to the Scotch common-sense school of philosophers,
and who treats all questions in a business-like
manner, has drawn up a scheme of such an education,
which any one can carry out for himself. It is so
excellent that I present its main features, with amplifications
of my own.</p>

<p><span class="decoration">a.</span> A Knowledge of the Bodily Constitution.</p>

<p>This means an acquaintance with the outlines of anatomy
and physiology, the rules of personal and general hygiene,
some understanding of the most prevalent diseases in the
locality in which we live and those to which we are individually
most liable, and the simplest means for their prevention
and treatment; what best to do in cases of sudden
accidents and emergencies; and last, though not least, the
precepts for training, strengthening, and beautifying the
body and the features.</p>

<p><span class="decoration">b.</span> The Elements of the principal Physical and Chemical
Sciences.</p>

<p>Even a rudimentary knowledge of the sciences of chemistry,
geology, geography, astronomy, of mechanics,
steam, electricity, etc., such as can be acquired from
primary text-books, increases wonderfully our interest in
the world around us and in what we see and hear every
day of our lives, and thus furnishes a thousand sources
<!--046.png--><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 42</span>
of enjoyment, besides being certain to find numerous
practical applications of utility.</p>

<p><span class="decoration">c.</span> The Study of the Mind.</p>

<p>This is at once a delightful pastime and an indispensable
art for success in many lines of business. It means an
acquaintance with the motives which actuate men in their
decisions, the personal traits which make up their characters,
their passions and their ambitions, their weaknesses
and their prejudices. Men distinguished for what is
called “executive ability,” statesmen, diplomatists, promoters
and managers of great enterprises, all either possess
by nature or have acquired by study this insight, and to it
they owe their success. To some degree, all can attain it
by observation of those around them, and by the perusal
of works which explain the constitution of the mind and
the dominant motives of human action. To this should
be added an unprejudiced reading of modern politics and
history, especially of one’s own country and State.</p>

<p><span class="decoration">d.</span> A Knowledge of the Principles of Business.</p>

<p>Worry about business affairs is probably the commonest
cause of unhappiness. A great deal of it is inevitable;
but a large share of it would be prevented were both sexes
taught early in life the general rules and customs of
business, and those principles of financial management,
investment, prudence, and economy, which are nearly as
fixed in their operation as those of the motions of the
stars. There are many popular handbooks on this subject,
and one such ought to be in every household.</p>

<p><!--047.png--><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 43</span>
<span class="decoration">e.</span> A Study of the Value of Evidence.</p>

<p>A remarkable writer, De Senancour, who under the
name of Obermann composed some strange books early in
this century, maintained that if men would tell the truth
and could predict the weather, nearly all the sufferings
which afflict humanity would disappear. There is a great
deal in his opinion. At present, all men have a rooted
aversion to truth, and neither wish to tell it nor to hear it
beyond a strictly limited amount. But as a knowledge of
facts is essential to right action, the estimation of evidence
and the calculation of probabilities are necessary to a
prosperous life. A man who has this faculty is said to be
gifted with “sound judgment,” but it is quite as much an
acquirement as a gift. There are well-known principles
by which the value of testimony is balanced and the
weight of evidence decided. They are in daily application
in our courts, and can be applied at least as successfully
to affairs outside.</p>

<p>Such are the outlines of an education directed toward
increasing the sources of enjoyment and diminishing the
causes of suffering; and what remains to be said is little
more than an extension of the principles thus laid down.</p>

<p><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> The second principle is the maintenance of a high
sensibility to pleasurable impressions.</p>

<p>To reach the right meaning of this we must begin with
physiology. All impressions of the nervous system, that is
to say, all feelings, may be compared or studied with reference
to three criteria, their Quality, their Intensity, and
<!--048.png--><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 44</span>
their Persistence. Feelings of the same quality, as a rule,
heighten each other’s intensity, but persistence is usually
inversely to intensity. The keener the sensation, the
shorter its duration. The story is told of a French scholar
who, for suspected heresy, was subjected to judicial torture
on the rack. When the instrument was extended the first
time, dislocating several of his joints, he uttered a cry of
agony; but at the second extension he burst into laughter.
“At my own ignorance,” he explained, “to suppose that
I could feel such suffering twice.”</p>

<p>It is essential to anything like a constant flow of pleasurable
feelings that we maintain a high state of vigor in
the organs of sensibility; and this can only be accomplished
by a careful limitation of intensity in favor of persistence
of feeling. Occasional nervous impressions of a
very high degree of intensity are not only consistent with
health, but increase it; but their frequent repetition, and
especially the determined effort to maintain them for long
periods, inevitably result in a deadening of the sensibility
and a lack of response to ordinary and healthful stimuli.</p>

<p>The ignorance or disregard of these physiological laws
explains some of the most disastrous and conspicuous failures
to attain happiness where every circumstance seems
propitious. The neglect of them is the origin of that
morbid condition of the mind which has been called “the
disease of the century,” <a name="chg1" id="chg1"></a><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la maladie de la siècle</i>,&mdash;Ennui.</p>

<p>The bitter pessimist, Schopenhauer, delighted to show
the worthlessness of life, whose only variety is from the toil
<!--049.png--><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 45</span>
of pursuit to the ennui of possession; while the sweet
mystic, Pascal, discovering in the same feeling the greatest
misery of man, saw in it that which would prove his salvation,
for it would lead him to renounce the vanities of the
world and give himself unto God. The one opinion is
worth as much as the other.</p>

<p>If we make an anatomy of Ennui, as Burton made an
anatomy of Melancholy, we shall find that two different,
though allied, mental conditions have been grouped under
the name.</p>

<p>The one is that sense of immeasurable boredom which
we feel when placed in uncongenial conditions, especially
such as ought to be welcome to us, as listening to good
advice, or hearing instructive lectures, or reading useful
books,&mdash;like this one. We are driven to any revolt by such
inflictions. The scholar will turn gypsy and the virtuous
youth a vagrant to escape them. As a boy, at stiff company
dinners, I used to suffer from a keen desire to throw
a plate through the window, or commit some other outrageous
breach of decorum.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of this innate revolt against conventionalism
and formality and respectability? The
divines are ready to tell you that it is a clear case of original
sin. It is nothing of the kind. It is the inherited
and unquenchable thirst for freedom in the human
heart, and in some temperaments the strength of this
passion for liberty is such that any sacrifice is cheap to
purchase it.</p>

<p><!--050.png--><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 46</span>
Perhaps these have not the worst of the bargain.
“Who is the happiest man in France?” some one asked
the academician, D’Alembert. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelque misérable</i>, “Some
wretched fellow,” he replied. There is infinite philosophy
in his answer. Browning, in <cite>Fifine at the Fair</cite>, discusses
the question with amazing insight into human motive.

<p>He finds the answer in the “frenzy to be free” which is
the ruling passion in such characters as he describes. He
is right, for ennui of this kind is unknown in conditions
of the largest personal freedom, as in the savage state and
among the vagabonds of society.</p>

<p>The other form of ennui arises not from external conditions,
but from those which are within. It is a species of
dissatisfaction with self. A man is generally his own
stupidest companion. According to the proverb, “Poor
company is better than none;” because the poorest of all
is oneself. A curious paradox that has been noted is that
the more a man thinks about himself, the less he cares to
be alone with himself! We no longer shun solitude from
the dread of bandits or ghosts, but to escape the sight of
the specters which arise within ourselves. How many of
us can boast of the “sessions of sweet silent thought”
which the poet praises as the crown of felicity? Amid
the gay throng of pleasure-seekers at Ranelagh, Dr. Johnson
<!--051.png--><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 47</span>
felt himself distressed by the reflection, “That there
was not one in all that brilliant circle who was not afraid
to go home and think.”</p>

<p>There is a moral virtue which the Roman philosophers
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sufficientia</i> and the Germans <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Selbstgenügsamkeit</i>,
which terms are not at all translated by the English “self-sufficiency.”
Let the word go; the thing is what is
needed. Make yourself an agreeable companion to yourself,
and this form of ennui will be known to you no
longer. This can only be accomplished by the constant
and well-directed exercise of your personal activities, and
by the maintenance of a high degree of sensibility to
pleasurable impressions.</p>

<p><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> The search for novelty and variety of impressions.</p>

<p>The Art of Happiness prescribes that instead of cultivating
a limited number of pleasurable impressions up to
a high degree of intensity, we should seek a large variety,
diverse in quality, moderate in intensity, considerable in
persistence. This precept, properly understood, is consistent
not only with a high, but perhaps with the highest
degree of gratification, for it is supported by another
physiological law of the greatest interest. This is, that
the utmost zest of pleasure is invariably conditioned on
the entire novelty of the sensation. This fact is so familiar
that it is embalmed in common proverbs, as that
“Variety is the spice of life,” and the like. But the
deep significance and the manifold applications of these
sayings are rarely considered.</p>

<p><!--052.png--><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 48</span>
Entire novelties are within the reach of few, and come
of themselves but seldom. Fortunately, their agreeable
effect can be closely imitated by influences quite within
our own control; that is, by the remission and alternation
of the pleasures already our own. This alone will maintain
the efficacy of any pleasure, for it is a sad fact that in
impressions on the nervous system, persistence can never
become permanence. Remission and reaction in all sensations
are demanded by that eternal and infinite law of
Periodicity, or Rhythmical Recurrence, which is the last
and highest in the Universe of mind or matter. This in
turn enforces on us the importance of aiming for a multiplicity
of sources of pleasure, so that we may heighten their
impressions by frequent variety.</p>

<p>Here again we come into conflict with that cherished
delusion which makes contentment and tranquillity the
chief elements of happiness. With political economists,
it often arises from a confusion of the spheres of the State
and the Individual. The State properly aims at peace,
established order, routine, and material ends; but the
Individual should seek variety and activity, he should try
untrodden paths and risk unknown crises. This alone will
make him a many-sided, strong character, responsive up to
the full measure of his powers to all impressions of
natural enjoyment.</p>

<p>The foe he has to guard against in this joyous quest is
Habit. This is the tyrant whose iron scepter enslaves
most men. The promptings of pleasure and pain are far
<!--053.png--><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 49</span>
from being the only incentives; probably they are by no
means the most numerous or potent. The “ruling motives”
of most persons are simply the associations, customs,
ideas, and aims with which they have been longest in contact.
A given mental tendency soon becomes predominant,
its easy yoke becomes adjusted to the neck, and the man
pursues his way in life without more resistance than the ox
to the wain. Vain the attempt to break his fetters and
sever the bonds of his habits. He is satisfied to reply, as
the Arab to the visitor, who would teach him a better agriculture--“Thus
did my father before me and thus my
mother taught me; and in this manner shall I continue.”</p>

<p>All attempts to make men happier on a large scale have
been shattered against the rock of this stubborn conservatism.
Only at rare intervals has it been riven by the shock
of some mighty emotion which has swept, tornado-like,
over the soul of a nation, uprooting the tangled growths
of bigotry and routine. The only hope is that here and
there an individual will arise and say to himself, “I shall
believe nothing merely because those around me believe
it; I shall do nothing merely because I am accustomed to
do it; I shall render to myself a reason for my every decision
and act.”</p>

<p>If some one asks, Why this invective against Habit, easy
Habit, soft as a padded chair, comfortable as an old shoe?
the answer must come from an analysis of mind. I have
before shown that all true motives of the Will are directed
toward the avoidance of pain or the attainment of pleasure.
<!--054.png--><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 50</span>
These alone are clearly conscious motives, distinguishing
between Self and Object, and therefore heightening to the
sense of individual life. Whatever we do “by habit,” on
the other hand, we do, in a greater or less degree, by what
physiologists call “unconscious cerebration,” and through
the involuntary action of our nervous and muscular systems.
This automatic action of our organism is constantly encroaching
on our consciousness, submerging it, like the
tide the shore; darkening it, like the night the landscape;
swallowing it inch by inch, like the boa his prey.
The struggle against Habit, therefore, and all that Habit
means, prejudice, bias, bigotry, authority, is a struggle
for life, and the nation, the society, the individual, who
succumbs in the contest is, by the very fact, bound hand
and foot and cast into utter darkness.</p>

<p><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> The establishment of a proper proportion between
desire and pleasure.</p>

<p>Through the mouth of Hamlet Shakespeare makes the
philosophical reflection&mdash;“There is nothing either good
or bad but <em>thinking</em> makes it so;” in other words, the value
of anything reckoned in the currency of enjoyment, lies
not in the thing itself but in the strength of our wish for
it. Most of the aims of effort are like curios, whose price
is gauged entirely by the anxiety of the amateur to obtain
them, and not by any intrinsic quality.</p>

<p>In life there is no more useful faculty than to be able to
put the right price on pleasures. The best of prudential
maxims is “Count the cost.” The outlay of effort should
<!--055.png--><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 51</span>
be in a just relation to the return which can be reasonably
reckoned upon. A given pleasure should be sought with
an energy strictly in proportion to the gratification which
it can actually yield,&mdash;not in proportion to a false ideal of
that gratification as portrayed by the exaggerations of
passion or morbid desire. When infatuation or fascination
or an over-heated imagination leads the chase, horse
and rider will be soon landed in the ditch. Pain and
disappointment ever follow an end sought in excess of its
real value. Again to quote the great dramatist, the “expense
of passion” is sure to be succeeded by “a waste of
shame.”</p>

<p>The precept of education which is thus enforced is the
regulation of desire by reflection and deliberation. Proceed
to an appraisement, as in business affairs. Ask yourself
the grounds of your desire. Is it from experience, or
merely on hearsay, and from a groundless imagining of
what the object might yield if attained? If it is from
experience, and the tasted sweet whets anew the appetite,
recall the reaction and the consequences, and if they
were unpleasant, present them fully before the bar of your
judgment. If imagination alone influences you, remember
that you are playing the children’s game of “swapping
in the dark,” and are liable to exchange solid value for
dross. “Depraved affections,” observes Lord Bacon,
“are false valuations.”</p>

<p><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> The last of the five principles stated is the crown of
all of them,&mdash;Make all pleasures a part of happiness.</p>

<p><!--056.png--><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 52</span>
I have already explained the difference between mere
pleasurable sensation and happiness in the true sense of the
term. While the former belongs to man’s animal nature,
the latter is intimately associated with the consciousness of
Self. The power of discriminating one’s Self from the rest
of the universe, and making one’s Self the subject of one’s
own observation is a faculty peculiar to man alone. There
is nothing which lends him more potent aid to accomplish
this than his pleasurable sensations. This alone imparts to
them any real value in the history of the individual or the
race, and through this their value becomes inestimable.</p>

<p>This has always been recognized as true of some of them;
but the error of most teachers has been that they have
refused to acknowledge the value of all pleasure to this
end, the excellence of all enjoyment, when it is brought
into relation to the full nature of man. Some have claimed
that the charms derived from the esthetic and benevolent
emotions are enough to fill our lives; others advocate intellectual
joys; many preach that the religious sentiment offers
all that man needs; while counselors of an opposite tendency
cry, “Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow ye
die.”</p>

<p>All are wrong. The spirit of sound culture will recognize
the whole nature of man and the solidarity of all his
parts, and will insist on respecting that unity, if his true
development is to be accomplished. For this reason it
will strive to render the pleasures of the senses and emotions
as intellectual as possible; and with not less earnestness
<!--057.png--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 53</span>
will aim to keep the pleasures of the intellect in touch with
the emotions and the senses. Its principle will be that the
more intimately the gratifications of sense are infused with
emotion and thought, the more they will be both purified
and strengthened; and the closer the web into which
we can weave the austere joys of the reason along with the
emotions and the feelings, the more sympathetic, wide-reaching,
and ennobling will those joys become. As the
ancient mason mingled water from the sky with clay from
the earth to make the bricks wherewith to build the temple,
so the permanent structure of human progress can be erected
only by combining in due proportion the extremes of
man’s delights.</p>

<p>A real though mysterious bond unites sense with that
which is above and beyond sense. Toward this Unknown
it is ever striving, though blindly and unconsciously. In
lower forms of life this has led to that marvelous series of
transformations which, at last, have reached their culmination
in man. In him the struggle no longer expends itself
in physical changes, but frames the ideals which float before
his mind, constantly spurring him to attempt the
impossible. Rest assured that the analogy which holds
good throughout all organic nature fails not in him, its
most perfect production. Somehow, by unknown ways
and under the guidance of unseen laws, his unwearying
effort to discover the invisible in the visible, the permanent
in the transient, the ideal in the real, will infallibly lead
him in triumph to the final goal of all Life. Whenever,
<!--058.png--><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 54</span>
without ulterior aim and for its own sake, we give ourselves
up to the admiration of some grand scene in nature or masterful
production of human art, we feel and recognize how
near to us, how much a part of us, is that invisible and
ideal world in which are set up the goals of man’s noblest
aspirations. To unite these opposites, to illuminate the
pleasures of sense with the light of the ideal, and, on the
other hand, to capture its evanescent rays by entangling
them in material enjoyments, is the final precept of the
Art of Happiness.</p>

<hr />

<p>Anthropology, the Science of Man, is the point of
convergence of all the other sciences; and the one aim of
the Science of Man is the Happiness of man; thus the
Pursuit of Happiness is the end of all pursuits. Pope displayed
the inspiration of the poet when he devoted the
final epistle of the Essay on Man to a discussion of,</p>

<p class="center small">“Happiness, our being’s end and aim.”</p>

<hr />

<p>The study of Philosophy, said Socrates, is the studying
how to die. I add, that the study of Happiness is the
studying how to live; and that he who acquires either,
possesses both.</p>

<hr />

<p>Rules for happiness are worth studying, even if they
are no better than the rules for writing poetry: which are
said to prevent ill poets, if they never make good ones.</p>


<hr />

<p><!--059.png--><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 55</span>
Fortunately, happiness is a tree with many roots. It
does not depend entirely on outward circumstances; nor
entirely on temperament or health; nor entirely on ourselves
or on others; nor entirely on prudence or study.
By cultivating any one of these, the tree will bear some
fruit. So bounteous are the gifts of nature, that if we
simply reduce the evils of life to something manageable,
our happiness will often take care of itself.</p>

<hr />

<p>All history teaches that those who renounce pleasure for
themselves are least scrupulous about inflicting pain on
others.</p>

<hr />

<p>Genuine pleasure has this unique trait: the more you get
for yourself, the more you provide for others.</p>

<hr />

<p>Pleasure and pain are common to all animals; and man’s
most exalted joys and sorrows bear a family likeness to
these universal sensations.</p>

<hr />

<p>In a certain sense, every pleasure is a victory, every pain
a defeat; the former is allied to movements of attack, the
latter to those of defense or submission.</p>

<hr />

<p>Pains are pains to all; while there are many pleasures
which are such to but a few; though there is no reason but
ignorance why they are not shared by the many.</p>

<hr />

<p><!--060.png--><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 56</span>
The bliss of ignorance consists in not knowing how much
we never had, and in living unaware of the worst of our
mistakes.</p>

<hr />

<p>Spiritualize your senses; the lowest of them may become
first in the kingdom of culture. Sensualize your intellect;
only thus can you attain the companionship of those noble
brethren, Humanity and Urbanity.</p>

<hr />

<p>Our happiest moments are those in which we believe we
can realize our ideals.</p>

<hr />

<p>Those who condemn the pursuit of Happiness reveal the
baseness of their own conception of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>The doctrine that we should get rid of our wants by
extinguishing our desires is suited to the clown in the
story, who cut off his ears because they were cold.</p>

<hr />

<p>Self-realization is widely different from self-manifestation.</p>

<hr />

<p>An error that persuades us we are happy is more
welcome than a truth which shows us we are not.</p>

<hr />

<p>Life is a sphere with an infinite number of sides; but,
like the terrestrial globe, to each individual it seems a
plain, bounded by his own horizon, with himself in its
center.</p>

<p>To live happily, we must in the first place <em>live</em>. Transparent
truism, but how often forgotten! How many of our
pleasures tend to weaken life, rather than to strengthen
and to lengthen it!</p>

<p>Some philosophers have found the sense of existence a
sufficient synonym for happiness. Sir William Hamilton
expressed this opinion with perhaps an ambiguous under-meaning
when he said,&mdash;“To lead a happy life is to live
all the days of one’s life;” but Dr. Johnson, moralizing on
the learned pig, expanded the idea more clearly when he
maintained that the mere prolongation of existence is a
sufficient compensation for a very considerable amount of
suffering. We see the correctness of his observation in the
multitude of examples of those who cherish their years
when poverty, old age, and disease would seem to have
<!--062.png--><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 58</span>
robbed them of all value. When nothing else is left but
life, life alone becomes worth all else.</p>

<p>Self-preservation, therefore, which means the care of life
and health, is the first and a necessary condition of personal
happiness. But what a task is this!</p>

<p>When the child wakes to consciousness and surveys the
scene around him, he finds himself on a battle-field divided
between two mighty combatants in unremitting conflict&mdash;Necessity
and Chance, the laws of Nature and the caprices
of Accident. Not even the gods, said the ancient
Greeks, can struggle with Fate and Fortune, those elemental
powers, Anangke and Tyke. What is man that he
dare venture the fray?</p>

<p>Each individual is scarcely more than a volume of quotations
from the works of his ancestors, selected with little
appropriateness to the Essay on Life which he has himself
to compose. Mysterious and unrecorded influences extending
over untold generations have combined to make
him what he is, and to endow him with a personality
which he can never escape from, nor transcend. The boy,
the man, can no more run away from his parents than he
can from himself. He may renounce and cast out the
traits which he has inherited, but he cannot get rid of
them. Unbidden and unnoticed, they will slink back and
abide with him forever. They are not his servants, but
belong to his family, his clan, his race. He can change or
dismiss them no easier than he can the color of his skin or
the shape of his skull.</p>

These are the laws of Heredity. They bind the individual
as with a tether to an immovable stake. But the tether is
not a fetter. It allows him a certain freedom, so that
within the limits of those laws he can wonderfully modify
himself and better his fortunes. More than that, he can
“cozen the gods,” and outwit both Fate and Fortune, if
he sets about it right. And how is that? By learning the
laws of his own nature and of the physical surroundings
which environ him. Knowing them, he can turn them to
his own advantage.</p>

<p>Let us see what these are; and first, those which concern
the bodily and mental constitution of the individual, so
far as they bear upon his happiness in life.</p>

<p>Those who have studied this subject, physicians and
physiologists, draw a twofold distinction in the traits of
the individual, discriminating between those which he has
by birth, and those which can be traced to incidents in his
own history after birth. Of the former, some are “hereditary,”
that is, traceable with reasonable surety to his
ancestors; and others “congenital,” meaning those which
appear to be due to incidents in his own history before
birth. To this latter curious class belongs the development
of what anatomists call “monsters;” and there are
thousands such in the moral world from allied causes, of
whom the anatomist takes no heed, the whole complexion
of whose lives has been changed by some light impression
at this infinitely susceptible period.</p>

<p>Of hereditary traits, the most salient are those which
<!--064.png--><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 60</span>
stamp on the individual his racial and ethnic characteristics.
He is a white man or a negro, a Mongolian or an American
Indian; he is, within these limits, a Jew or a Greek, a
Chinaman or a Japanese; each with his own features, color
of skin, straight or crisp hair, and all the other marks,
mental and physical, which belong to his particular race
and people. Each one of these will help or handicap him
in the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>Less prominent, but yet indefinitely potent, are those
characteristics which he inherits from his family or clan,
and from his immediate parents. To these he generally
owes his stature, his physical strength, his symmetry and
beauty, or his lack of these, his constitutional diseases, his
longevity, and his language,&mdash;all mighty agents in turning
the kaleidoscopic pictures of his future life. From this
source he probably also derives that which physicians call
his “temperament,” which is in many instances the trait
which decides on his general happiness or unhappiness in
life; for it is often observed that a particular temperament
descends for generations in the same family.</p>

<p>The “congenital” peculiarities are those which especially
mark the individual. Sex is one of these. Physiologists
now know that the human individual commences of
the neuter gender, and that the decision as to whether it
shall be masculine or feminine is an incident, or more justly
an accident, of its later life. Certain diseases, malformations,
and bodily marks are also congenital, as well as those
slight variations of the form and features which make up
<!--065.png--><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 61</span>
the physical personality; and more than all, to the obscure
and momentous period when the spirit is folded in the
womb does the individual owe his strongest tastes and inclinations,
his talents, and, when he possesses it, the divine
endowment of genius. Therefore the physicians of
ancient times established the maxim,&mdash;“<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ingenium est
ingenitum</cite>.”</p>

<p>With this miscellaneous stock of heirlooms, with this
farrago of festering rags and family jewels, poisoned fangs
of serpents and fragments of holy crosses, ancient formulas
of withering curses and saintly blessings whispered by a
thousand generations of ancestors, the babe is born into
the world. His one duty in life is to battle with these
unseen but fateful influences, to defend his freedom against
their subtle approaches, to master their armories, and to
maintain and develop ever more and more his own separate
individuality, utilizing his inherited powers and
tendencies or destroying them, as they make for or against
his own true happiness.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, he will call to his aid such powerful
allies as education, self-training, personal hygiene, the
establishment of desirable habits, and the assistance of
trusty friends. By such aids he can modify his own nature,
and Fate cannot wholly prevail against him. He will
realize the meaning of the noble words of Buddha, the
Awakened,&mdash;“Self is the Lord of Self; who else should be
the Lord?”</p>

<p><!--066.png--><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 62</span>
Let us see in some detail what he has to contend with,
and how he should set about it.</p>

<p>Nature is equitable. The more inflexible her laws, the
wider the liberty they allow; the stronger the rivets of her
chains, the longer they are. Thus it is that racial peculiarities,
though the most indelible of all, do not stand in
the way of man’s enjoyment. They do indeed limit the
quality, but probably not the quantity, of pleasure in life.
The race which anatomists consider the lowest, the African
negroes, is famous for its gayety and buoyant spirits.
Danger, poverty, even slavery, do not quench their cheery,
care-free disposition. The majority of them are like
Hamlet’s friend, Horatio, with naught but their good spirits
to feed and clothe them. Little reck they of the future.
Music and song, talk and laughter, are all they want to fill
their days.</p>

<p>How different the American Indian! not that he is the
solemn and taciturn savage whom the romance-writers
depict. In his native state he is light-hearted, too; but
there is one poison a single drop of which embitters all his
cup of joy, the poison of restriction. Lessen his liberty
ever so little, and all light is shut out of his days. Everywhere
the race is the same. Its surroundings count as
nothing. In the long Arctic night the Eskimo is blithe
and carolsome, far from the approach of the white man;
while amid the glorious scenery and Eden-like climate of
Central America, the native languages have a dozen words
<!--067.png--><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 63</span>
for pain and misery and sorrow for one with any cheerful
signification.</p>

<p>The white race has a greater range and a higher quality
in sensation and emotion than any other. Modern
psychologists&mdash;who are in fact physiologists&mdash;have demonstrated
this by experiments. The white race alone
responds to the most delicate stimuli in art, in religion,
and in scientific thought; and probably its members
alone are, as a race, capable of the highest degrees of
happiness; though single individuals of the other races
doubtless may equal them in this respect.</p>

<p>Let the individual of any race not despair of joy. Let
him pursue it with a firm intent and a clear understanding
of what it is, and he will surely receive it to the capacity
of which his nature is capable. The barriers of race or
nation fence him off from no flowery fields or sun-lit
pastures. There are gates, if he will seek them, which
open on them all.</p>

<p>More ominous to his welfare are the traits he inherits
from his own family, his immediate ancestors. How true
it is that a man’s worst enemies may be those of his own
household! How dreadful it is that they may be those
who love him most, who brought him into the world, who
would die for him! As in Ibsen’s terrible drama, the
ghosts of the follies of our fathers may ever hover near us,
poisoning our blood, darkening our daylight, blighting
our lives, transmitting to us the seeds of insanity, the
mortal leaven of consumption, or the loathsome virus
<!--068.png--><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 64</span>
sucked from the breasts of illicit pleasure. Who can
deliver us from the body of this death?</p>

<p>No one but ourselves. Here more than elsewhere it is
vain to sit by the wayside and cry to the passers-by for
aid. Scant is the consolation and slight the assistance
they can proffer us. We must ourselves search the arid
plains for such meagre roses and shriveled leaves as
remain for us to twine the chaplets of pleasure. He who
is born to an inheritance of disease&mdash;and the majority
are&mdash;should boldly recognize it as his special danger, and
should study the means of its prevention. If of the serious
character of those I have mentioned, he should make it his
main business to escape its inroads by choosing an appropriate
avocation, by removal to other surroundings, and
by adopting a course of life which medical science
prescribes as that most likely to postpone indefinitely its
outbreak. There are thousands of such wise men in every
civilized community, who were born with these blood-taints,
but who successfully escape them,&mdash;till they fall a
victim to some other malady. Nor have these by any
means the worst part of life. The habit of constant
watchfulness and forethought thus engendered is one of
the most valuable guarantees of personal happiness; this is
why among confirmed and chronic invalids we often meet
a degree of cheerfulness and even gayety which surprises
us.</p>

<p>These beings are doubly fortunate; for they have
escaped not only their particular malady, but another not
<!--069.png--><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 65</span>
less dangerous to their own well-being and that of those
around them&mdash;a morbid valetudinarianism, a perpetual
fussiness about their own ills and ails. The victims of this
complaint are the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malades imaginaires</i>, constantly coddling
themselves, thinking of no one but themselves, of whom
we meet an endless number in the wealthier classes of
society. It must have been of such as these that old Dr.
Johnson blurted out his rough judgment,&mdash;“Every sick
man is a scoundrel!” They usually forfeit more than
they win by such selfish concentration. It is a symptom
of disease to think constantly about one’s health. The
most effectual remedy for it is to think about increasing
the comfort of others.</p>

<p>There is no need for me to go into details of what such
a training should be to protect one as much as possible
against the development of hereditary diseases. The precepts
must be adapted to the particular case and circumstances,
and in this age Personal Hygiene is a science by
itself, with abundant and competent instructors. Its scope
is not limited to the prevention of disease, but extends to
the strengthening and symmetrical development of the
whole body. No one who intelligently pursues his happiness
will omit the study and practice of its precepts.
Health is not indispensable to happiness. Fortunately, no
one condition is indispensable. But there is no other condition
which so generally and potently contributes to it.
Therefore, he who intelligently seeks enjoyment will pay
early and frequent attention to athletic culture; he will
<!--070.png--><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 66</span>
seek some healthful and agreeable physical exercise; his
posture will be erect and his breathing full; his periods of
effort will be prolonged to positive fatigue, and will be
judiciously alternated by others of changed activity or
complete repose.</p>

<p>The trainer of athletes lays down for his pupils a rigid
discipline. He is as far from encouraging overstrain and
excessive exercise as he is indolence. He condemns stimulants
and narcotics beyond a most moderate use; and he
is solicitous about such things as sleep, and food, and
cleanliness. If his pupils find it repays them to submit to
his stringent dicta for the hope of winning a champion’s
belt or a silver medal, is it not worth while to accept the
much less severe regimen necessary to obtain the Olympian
garland woven of the joys which a sound and elastic health
offers?</p>

<p>All that I have said on this subject applies with even
greater force to girls and women than it does to youths and
men. Women, alas, as I have before remarked, have the
worser part in life. No one but a physician sees how much
of their wretchedness is owing to ignorance or neglect of
the laws of physical health. There is no excuse for this in
this day. The wicked old doctrine which taught that
ignorance of their own nature is a necessary condition of
innocence in girls ought long since to have been cast out
of window. It is as false as that the seclusion of a harem
is necessary to insure the virtue of wives. In nine cases
out of ten a woman’s health in life depends on the care she
<!--071.png--><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 67</span>
exercises between early puberty and the birth of her first
child; and this is the precise period when the prejudices
of society strive to keep her in profoundest ignorance of
the laws which govern her own bodily functions!</p>

<p>More delightful to any true woman than the pleasures of
health or the praise of her faculties is the adoration compelled
by her beauty. Madame de Stael regretted that she
could not exchange her magnificent powers and her literary
fame for the personal charms of Madame Recamier. She
was right. Let no woman be persuaded to abate one jot
or tittle in her cult and culture of the comely in face and
form. Only cramped bigots and dull pedants cheapen the
value of beauty.</p>

<p>Beauty is real; it is that which alone is permanent and
visible; it lurks behind a thousand masks and distorted
countenances, ever struggling to body itself forth; it is
the manifestation of potent and mysterious natural laws,
which but for it would remain forever hidden from us. Its
proud power is to awaken Love with all her joyous train;
and Love means the unconscious attraction of the Ideal,
the noblest incitement to human endeavor.</p>

<p>These are not mere phrases. They are facts proved by
the life-history of the human race. As nations advance in
civilization from the savage condition to one of enlightenment,
their ideals of physical beauty steadily near a definite
and the same conception of the perfect human form, the
underlying motive of which is the highest function and a
perfected capacity. This progress is rapid in proportion as
<!--072.png--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 68</span>
that which is peculiarly human in man is cultivated beyond
that which is merely animal. Not that any rigid canon
of proportion or mechanical norm will ever be attained;
because the endeavor is toward the Ideal, and this is
beyond the reach of mortals.</p>

<p>These are the teachings of the learned in the Science of
Man; they are constantly supported by the experience of
history. Beauty is and ever has been the Desire of all Nations.
For it, in all time, men have counted as nought their
honor, their gold, and their hopes of heaven. For it, they
have poured their heart’s blood on a thousand stricken
fields, and laughed at death and hell. Think you that the
noblest of the race would have thus reckoned the world
well lost, and paid all that, wisdom holds precious for a
smile from the lips of loveliness, were there not some
strange and wondrous compensation, some immortal and
unearthly significance, in Beauty itself?</p>

<p>There is such significance, and nowhere is it so visible as
in the perfect female face and form. This is the most beautiful
of all objects in nature or art. To it we turn to gaze,
forgetting the works of the greatest masters which may be
spread before us; unmindful of the sublimest scenes which
mountain and lake may combine to show us. Nearer than
anything else does it bring us to that Ideal World whose
margin forever recedes as we approach it; louder in its
presence sound the tinkling bells of that Fairyland which
guards the fruition of our sweetest hopes and dreams.</p>

<p>The beauty of woman has been the incentive of physical
<!--073.png--><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 69</span>
progress in the race and the inspiration of its noblest arts.
It shadows forth the embodied ideal of humanity, and in
its resistless strength binds men as slaves to its chariot.
But does it confer happiness on the possessor?
Sad and faithful is the reply of the poet<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container no-break">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="indent8">“In every land</div>
  <div class="indent2">I saw, wherever light illumineth,</div>

  <div class="indent2">The downward slope to death.”</div>

<p><i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La fatale donna di bellezza</i>, “the fatal gift of beauty,”
says the proverb of the Italians. Perilous is the path of
mortals who walk too near the gods. The brightest beacons
are those which most attract the foul birds of night.
The men or the women who shine beyond their fellows
through the bounteous gifts of nature are the chosen targets
for envy and hatred and calumny and all their ugly crew.
In the clash of violent emotions excited by the radiance
of fair faces, in the contention of love and jealousy,
despair and passion, it is rare that the cause of it
all escapes scot free. Her wisdom is also weakened by the
adoration she receives; she assumes that it is for herself,
forgetful that a passing disease or the accident of a moment
may rob her of her charms forever. She has yet to learn
that those alone are worthy of admiration to whom it is
not a necessity.</p>

<p>Thus it happens that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis superba formæ</i>, the “proud
strength of beauty,” so often proves a fatal weakness to its
possessor. American women who have followed the fortunes
<!--074.png--><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 70</span>
of generations of belles tell me that those distinguished
for their physical charms have as a rule met with less success
and less happiness in their after life than their plainer sisters.
This is not as it should be. Regularity of features, mobility
of expression, harmony of coloring, symmetry of form,
and gracefulness of motion are the five sides of the mystic
pentagram of beauty, and, like that of the ancient astrologers,
it should have power to exorcise and banish all evil
spirits, and constrain men and demons to the willing service
of ennobling joys.</p>

<p>A beautiful woman is the nearest approach we have to
the perfected ideal of humanity in general. When in their
statues of Apollo, Adonis, and the Hellenized Antinous, the
ancient Greek sculptors portrayed their highest conception
of manly beauty, in many points they approximated the
male to the female form, recognizing in the lines of the
latter a superior artistic excellence and the consummate
expression of the ideal of the beautiful; nay, even the
embodiment of the supreme of intellectual gifts. “Something
feminine,” observed Coleridge in his Table Talk,
“is discoverable in the countenances of all men of
genius.” Therefore the artists represent angels as of that
age when the male is most similar to the female,&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tra
giovane e fanciullo</i>, between youth and childhood, as
Tasso describes the archangel Gabriel.</p>

<p>Great is the value of physical culture; but let there be
no misunderstanding as to what this value is. Such culture,
under whatever title it appears, is but a means to an end.
<!--075.png--><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 71</span>
They miss its meaning who make it an end in itself. Its
sole worth is to aid in bringing about that mental condition
or process which we term felicity, or joyousness.</p>

<p>This point is more easily carried in some constitutions
than in others. Much depends on what is called the
“temperament,” and so much has been written about
temperaments that I cannot afford to omit a reference to
them. To be sure, they do not fill so many pages in
modern writings as in those of an earlier age; but this may
be because they are not now so well marked as they once
were. Functions, like fashions, are subject to the law of
periodicity.</p>

<p>The four leading temperaments with their mental traits
are as follows: the sanguine, characterized by buoyant
hope and strong self-confidence; the nervous, with rapid
alternations of confidence and anxiety, prone to enthusiasm
and to dejection; the phlegmatic, equally remote
from the extremes of exaltation and despair, collected,
temperate, and slow; and the bilious, inclined to take the
gloomy view of events and to dwell on their darker side.</p>

<p>Most people can be classed under the one or the other
of these, and the arrangement is not useless in self-culture,
for it will furnish hints as to the manner of training
required to correct unwholesome mental tendencies.</p>

<p>The temperament toward which they should all be modified
is not included in the list. It is the <em>cheerful</em> temperament,
that which is lighted by the rays of reasonable hope
<!--076.png--><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 72</span>
and a confidence in one’s own powers grounded on a
knowledge of their strength.</p>

<p>Cheerfulness, however, is a coy favorite, and is not to
be had for the asking. It is a condition of mind which a
man cannot think himself into, nor reason himself into,
nor directly acquire by an effort of the will. No man can
seat himself in his chair and say to himself,&mdash;“Go to! I
will be merry!” It can in part be secured by a skillful
disposition of the emotions at our command; but it is, in
the main, the mental result of physical processes, and the
profitable study of it must begin with these.</p>

<p>So very physical is it, that physiologists have undertaken
to locate its exact seat in the human body. They
place it in the great ganglia of the sympathetic nervous
system, near the stomach and the heart, where also is
located the seat of the sense of general miserableness that
the French call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malaise</i>. No one feels happy in his head
or in his foot; but we do speak of being light of heart, as
well as heart-heavy and heart-broken. Those savage tribes
who believe that the soul dwells in the pit of the stomach
are not the worst physiologists.</p>

<p>The mental condition in certain diseases show how correct
this is. Those which directly involve the stomach,
the liver, the heart, and the intestinal canal are always
associated with undue depression of spirits; while those
which are confined to the lungs or the brain, though of
the most fatal gravity, may be connected with undiminished
<!--077.png--><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 73</span>
cheerfulness. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spes phthisica</i>, the hopefulness
of the consumptive, is proverbial among physicians, but as
deceptive to them as to others. A friend of mine, a
medical man, who had fought this disease for three years,
wrote me three days before his death, sketching a series of
literary schemes which he had decided to undertake!
Another malady of similar character is a variety of paralysis,
always fatal, not uncommon among overworked business
men of middle life. The patient will never acknowledge
that he is ill or feels badly, and when so paralyzed that he
cannot rise from his couch will insist that he is in splendid
health and is merely lazy! How different from the dyspeptic,
always magnifying his symptoms; from the hypochondriac
with engorged liver; or from the sufferer from
heart disease, with his long and inexplicable spells of low
spirits!</p>

<p>The moral of these facts is evident. If we wish to
have a cheerful disposition we must begin with attention to
our physical functions. Even slight symptoms of dyspepsia,
liver complaints, and disturbances of the digestive
organs must receive appropriate treatment. In this country
malarial poisoning is common, and as it spends its
force on the spleen, it is always associated with low spirits.
Hemorrhoids, which are usually connected with deficient
action of the liver, and in women many diseases peculiar
to their sex, act directly in inducing a condition of gloom
and anxiety.</p>

<p>Of course, it is no part of my plan to suggest the proper
<!--078.png--><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 74</span>
treatment for these ails. But it does come within its purview
to offer some hints to those who, without assignable
physical cause, are subject to periodic depression of spirits,
to what we familiarly call “an attack of the blues.”</p>

<p>This is generally a reaction from mental overstrain or
mental lethargy,&mdash;from the too intent pursuit of an object,
or from having no object to pursue. A life without leisure
and a life without labor are equally fatal to cheerfulness.
The hurry and rush of business affairs, the atmosphere of
excitement and unrest which surrounds them, are dangerous
to a mind not extremely well poised. Not less so are
the alternate phases of gloom and exaltation which attend
religious revivals, prayer meetings, and the various manifestations
of fanaticism. “That way madness lies,” and
our asylums show a heavy percentage of inmates who have
lost their reason from religious excitement. The prolonged
concentration of attention on one’s heavenly interests is
just as detrimental as on those of this world. Self-isolation
is fatal; and anxiety for self-salvation is but one of its
varieties.</p>

<p>While the multiplicity of rapid impressions leads to
exhaustion and mental lassitude, variety and novelty are
desirable. Change of diet is as salutary for the mind as
for the body. One should have some agreeable occupation
outside of his business, to which he can turn in his leisure
moments and at the time when he quits active affairs.
How many have I seen with enough to retire <em>on</em>, but with
nothing to retire <em>to</em>! They are the unhappiest of mortals.</p>

<p><!--079.png--><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 75</span>
An occasional fit of depression can be broken by some
simple measures. The hot bath is one of these. It is highly
physiological, as its imperative summons of the nervous
force to the periphery of the body breaks up the stagnation
about the ganglionic centres. For the same reason the
cold shower is excellent. No man leaves it in the same
train of thought with which he entered it. Active exercise,
society, games, and amusements will occur to all. Stimulants
and narcotics are perilous palliatives. Better try
Lord Lytton’s advice, and resolutely attack a new language;
or Ruskin’s, to drive a restless horse or sail a
cranky skiff, where the least inattention to what you have
in hand means immediate danger to your life. You will
have no time for the blues.</p>

<p>Self-preservation, I have said, is the prime condition of
happiness. A long life, therefore, is the desire of all sane
minds. Old age, that which all abhor, is the hope of all.
It alone justifies a man to himself and before others. The
sage is he whose life is a consistent whole, and who carries
out in his age the plans which he laid in youth. They are
not many; but even they deceive us by their number. On
the ocean of existence, who counts the shipwrecked? We
see the votive offerings of the saved displayed with ostentation,
but who notes the number of the drowned? In
the scenery of the drama of human life, the most conspicuous
buildings are the hospitals and asylums, and into these
sooner or later most of the actors disappear.</p>

<p>A learned French physician has maintained that the
<!--080.png--><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 76</span>
normal duration of human life is one hundred years; only
a fifth of those born reach one half that age. Longevity is
partly a birthright; it runs in families; but it is still more
a question of occupation, mode of life, and personal
hygiene. The Jews of Frankfurt average ten years more
of life than the non-Jewish citizens, because they avoid
unsanitary avocations and observe wiser rules of diet. I
know a skillful physician who claims that he can lengthen
the life of an individual a decade beyond the average of
his ancestors by a judicious system of safeguards. Such an
adviser is acquainted with the special dangers to which age
is exposed. He knows, for instance, that at seventy-five
exposure to cold is thirty-two times more dangerous than it
is at thirty years of age.</p>

<p>The sorrows of age are usually the returns of the investments
of youth, these proving of that sort which levy
assessments instead of paying dividends. “A short life
and a merry one,” is the maxim of many a youngster.
The hidden falsehood at the core of his philosophy is the
belief that happiness belongs to youth alone. I have
already referred to this dangerous fallacy. The bliss of
youth, as portrayed by poets and romancers, did not
belong to the youth I had, nor does it to the youths I
know. The admiration of the early periods of life is one
of a common class of illusions. There is greater charm in
beauty half-concealed than wholly shown, in the dawn
rather than in the day, in the promise of youth rather
than in the maturity of manhood. Potentialities please
<!--081.png--><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 77</span>
more than actualities, because they excite our imagination
and release us from the fetters of facts.</p>

<p>He who would work securely for his own welfare will
not be led astray by the belief that any one period of life
contains solely or in any large measure the enjoyments of
life as a whole. He will, therefore, not eat to-day the
bread of to-morrow. Rather he will consider the problem
of life akin to a problem of Euclid, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod erat demonstrandum</i>
of which is reached only in the last line. He
will guard the fires of youth, that he may not in age have
to sit by the cold ashes of exhausted pleasures.</p>

<p>Sad indeed is the fate of those men who live to outlive
themselves. You find them in every community, and
especially in those classes of society which offer the
greatest opportunities for early liberty and enjoyment.
They suffer from a kind of premature senility. They have
fallen in the struggle, though they are not visibly wounded.
To them, life has lost its zest and action its aim. Usually
this is the result of the early exhaustion of irrational
enjoyments; but it may proceed from some blow of
disappointed ambition, from a violent shock to the
emotions, from the vertigo of unlooked-for prosperity, or
the discouragement of persistent adversity. The stroke
has fallen, and no voice can awake them to action again.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <span class="title">Our Physical Surroundings.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">Palpably the nearest to us of all our physical surroundings
is our clothing. Philosophers do not agree whether
man originally adopted some covering for his body out of
the desire of warmth, the sense of modesty, or the love of
decoration. Enough that at present all these motives are
operative, and all are to be respected.</p>

<p>The first purpose of clothing is to preserve the health by
keeping out the cold. There is more in this than mere
comfort. Warm clothing economizes nervous energy,
which otherwise has to be expended on the extremities of
the nerves to maintain the capillaries in activity. A man
when comfortably warm can think more clearly than when
he feels chilly. Mind and body are alike benumbed by
extreme cold. Exposure to even a moderately low temperature
is dangerous to the aged and the frail. Those who
have studied the meteorology of health have established
the maxim,&mdash;“Waves of cold are waves of death.”</p>

<p>In his clothing the sensible man will conform to the
customs and station of society in which he moves. He
will leave to his tailor the cut of his coat. It is a sign of
greater weakness to affect a fashion of one’s own than to
follow that of others. He will not be without a dress suit
in civilized lands, and will not wear top boots in drawing
<!--086.png--><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 82</span>
rooms, as did in London a semi-celebrated American
poet.</p>

<p>A century or two ago the dress of men was far more
costly and significant. That they have now adopted a simple
and uniform style shows that higher interests are occupying
their minds. The first sign that women are approaching
the same level will be their enfranchisement from the
slavery of dress and fashion, to which so many of them
devote the best part of their lives. To woman, clothing
will always be more a question of art than utility. But
most of the modes which she now follows are caricatures
of art. For them, however, she will sacrifice not only
good taste but good morals. Vanity in dress, not the deception
of men, leads the majority of fallen women to
their life. They feel more degraded by an unbecoming
costume than by a tarnished reputation.</p>

<p>A man changes his character with his garments. Dirty
clothes excuse dirty actions. I heard of a carpenter who
was at a fire where he could easily have carried off articles;
but he explained that he had on his best clothes, and that
prevented him. The reason why sermons have so little
effect is that we lay aside our Sunday suits on Monday
morning. This is the value of uniform. Dress a hundred
men alike, and they will think alike. The character is
subdued to what ’tis clothed in. Outward, develops inward
conformity. The world recognizes this, and accepts
the clothing as the index of the mind. A well-dressed
man is supposed to be a gentleman, and an officer with
<!--087.png--><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 83</span>
sword and epaulettes is regarded as a tactician and a hero.
Would you change the current of your thoughts, change
your raiment, and you will at once feel the effect. Would
you assuage your grief, lay aside your mourning.</p>

<p>Next to our clothing, our immediate surroundings are
the room and its furniture. A third of our lives is passed
in our sleeping apartment, and most of the remainder in
sitting-room, library, or office. It is well worth while,
therefore, to give it attention. How much pleasure it can
be made to render! The genial Xavier de Maistre consumed
a month in making his celebrated <cite>Voyage autour de ma
Chambre</cite>, and then regretted his time was so short. What
harmonies of light and color, shade and perspective, even
the humblest adornment of a room is capable of yielding!
How each article of furniture comes to take its place in our
lives and memories! The clock, the desk, the lounge,
these are what make up the sense of Home. Even the
noble sentiment of patriotism is founded upon them. To
defend our hearth is its intimate purpose, and love of our
easy-chair is a large share of our love of country. To all
women and many men the most constant happiness of life
is centred in the room and its furniture. Here is the
temple of the Goddess of the Household, and her name
should be Lætitia.</p>

<p>How much, therefore, depends on the selection of our
living rooms! They should be light, bright, dry, airy,
well-ventilated, equably warmed, appropriately furnished,
free from bad odors, far from brutal noises, screened from
<!--088.png--><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 84</span>
impertinent curiosity. All these requirements ought to be
easily obtained and at no great cost. But so little does
modern architecture consider the true comfort and the real
happiness of house-dwellers that it is rare that one can find
all combined.</p>

<p>If he can, therefore, the wise man will prefer to build
his own house. Some will question this. Somewhere in
his works&mdash;they are too voluminous for me to look up the
reference&mdash;Rousseau argues that a philosopher will not
desire a house of his own, but will prefer to live in one
that is rented. He will thus consult his independence, be
free to come and go, not engage his affections on inanimate
objects, find his fatherland wherever he may be, and
the like.</p>

<p>For myself, I incline rather to the opinion of Abraham
Cowley, less of a philosopher than Rousseau but more in
sympathy with the general sentiments of mankind. I
agree with him that “the pleasantest work of human industry
is the improvement of something which we may call
our own.” There is something in itself delightful in the
mere sense of ownership of a part of the surface of the
earth. It was not mere greed in Cosmo de Medici, who,
when asked why he preferred his villa in the Apennines
to his palace in Florence, replied,&mdash;“Because there, every
foot of land I see is my own.” No prospect is quite so
pleasing as that of our own acres, and those governments
are strongest which base their institutions on the personal
tenure of land.</p>

<p><!--089.png--><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 85</span>
The old proverb prescribes the chief duties of a man to
be to build a house and beget a child. The character of
his child he can but slightly control; the plan of his house
is in his own hands, and his health and happiness are
deeply involved in it. “He that builds a fair house on
an ill site,” observes Bacon, “committeth himself to
prison;” and I may add, he that builds an ill house on
any site, sends himself and family to a hospital. One
half of the deaths in England are from preventable causes,
and one-half of these are causes connected with defective
house building. The most perfect buildings are the gaols.
Both in England and America the best care is taken of the
worst men. The chances of life for the convict who is in
prison is seven times better than when he is at liberty. If
health is the highest good, we had better all apply to be
sent to gaol.</p>

<p>The principal foes to fight are dampness, darkness, chilliness,
draughtiness, insufficient ventilation, sewer-gas or
other poisonous effluvia, contaminated or scanty water supply,
and unhealthful situation. Architects know little about
these matters. Decorative effects rather than sanitary perfection
are what occupy their attention. Every house-builder
should be his own architect to the extent of clearly
knowing what he wants, and seeing that it is looked after
in the plans.</p>

<p>A beautiful feature of American life is the ease with
which every one can acquire his own home. Rapid transit
facilitates this even for those who dwell in great cities.</p>

<p><!--090.png--><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 86</span>
The possession of his own house is within the reasonable
ambition of every man, and should ever form a part of it.
What if it must be a small house? He can say with
Socrates&mdash;“Lucky me, if I have friends enough to fill it!”</p>

<p>“Cosiness!” how much that word implies! What
pictures of intimate delights it brings before the mind!
But who can imagine it in great, straggling mansions, or
in “palace chambers far apart”? In the vast and gloomy
palace of the Escorial, the only rooms I saw which would
not induce an attack of melancholia to live in were a
suite not larger than those in an ordinary American house,
in which the royal family sought escape from the pressure
of their own magnificence in their occasional visits to this
famous pile. Happiness dwells not in spacious halls and
stately apartments, and he who seeks it will not envy
their possessors.</p>

<p>Has a house ever been built with an eye solely to the
highest happiness of its inmates? to their health, sometimes;
to their comfort, occasionally; to the parade of
their riches, constantly; but to their happiness? I doubt.
Conveniences, sanitary arrangements, agreeable vistas,
balconies, porches, fireplaces, these would not be omitted,
but would be merely the beginning of the plan. How to
conciliate isolation with social relations, how to promote
harmony between those serving and those served, how to
provide that the employments of one do not jar with those
of others, these would be some of the questions to consider.
How many family troubles could be avoided by a
<!--091.png--><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 87</span>
properly built house! Faulty architecture is more frequently
the ruin of family felicity than is heterodox doctrine.</p>

<p>The Greeks called man the “earth-born,” and the love
of his native place is ever one of the most responsive of his
heartstrings. Some say it is lacking in Americans, because
they are so restless, but this is an error. The poor boy
who wanders away from his native village to make his
fortune does not forget the scenes of his childhood, and
should his dreams be realized, returns to the old familiar
places to leave at least some token of his affection. More
than half the public libraries in New England towns have
been given wholly or in large part by those who were to
the manor born, but who had found fortune under strange
skies.</p>

<p>The scenery of our dreams is generally that with which
we were first familiar, and the dying old man babbles of
the green fields of his boyhood. We may admire grand
views from foreign belvederes, but those which we first
saw remain unsurpassed. I crossed the ocean with an
intelligent woman returning from the Rhine and the Alps;
but her longing was for the vast, treeless prairies of Illinois,
her girlish home, where sky meets earth all round the
horizon, and the soul feels no confinement of mountains
or forests.</p>

<p>Love of place rather than love of persons leads to the
unhappy condition of homesickness. As “nostalgia,” it
becomes an actual disease of body and mind, and men will
die of it, unless allowed to return to their native land.
<!--092.png--><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 88</span>
Haunting, imperious thirst of the soul for the scenes of its
early pleasures! Heaven cannot be imagined without them.</p>

<p>The thoughtful writer, Herder, who was the first to
cultivate history as the seed-field of philosophy, was of
opinion that it is less the earth on which we tread, than
the air we breathe, which gives the peculiar charm to the
scenes of childhood; meaning that it is the climate, and
the sequence of the seasons which leave the chief impress
on the budding observation of our surroundings. The
eternal summer of the tropics becomes monotonous to the
native of temperate latitudes, and the Eskimo or the
Laplander in the more genial climes pines for the short, hot
summer and bitter winter to which he has been accustomed.
The desire, therefore, for more favorable climates, except
for purposes of health, is an illusion. The “summer isles
of Eden” would fatigue with their monotony and enervate
by their excellence. The enjoyment of life is independent
of the thermometer, if we determine it shall be. Sunshine
within more than compensates for its absence without.</p>

<p>By climate we usually mean the weather, and this
unquestionably exerts a powerful influence on human
happiness. That of most portions of the United States
keeps the character which William Penn gave it two hundred
years ago&mdash;“constant in nothing but inconstancy.”
Many a project of pleasure does it mar, and many a
discomfort does it create! but in its very changeableness
there is something attractive, as always lurks in the
unexpected. If we travel the same road every day in the
<!--093.png--><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 89</span>
year, on no two are sky and landscape the same. Daily,
new scenes are offered to our sight, each with its peculiar
charm, if we take the trouble to look for it. Almost can
one reason himself into an equality with that unapproachable
philosopher, the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain, who,
when asked what the weather would be on the morrow,
replied that it would be just what he preferred; and on
further inquiry as to what this might be, triumphantly
answered, “Whatever the Lord sends.”</p>

<p>On some temperaments, a low barometer produces a
peculiarly depressing effect. The advice often given them
is to make renewed exertion at their customary employments,
and combat the disinclination with the Will. My
advice would be more agreeable; they should lay aside the
customary routine, if possible, and seek in change,
recreation, and amusements the cheerfulness which their
ordinary employment refuses them. Do not spur the jaded
horse, but rather offer repose and variety of motion.</p>

<p>The pressure of the atmosphere as indicated by the
barometer has a great deal to do directly with health and
spirits, and therefore with happiness. Those with a
tendency to heart disease should seek a residence at the
sea level, while many who have weak lungs will improve
where the air is rarefied by a high altitude. What the
Swiss call <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le mal des montagnes</i> is a general sense of
discomfort which some feel a few thousand feet above the
sea, and which even prolonged residence does not entirely
<!--094.png--><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 90</span>
banish. An asthmatic can have no pleasure in life unless
he finds the climate where he can breathe with comfort.</p>

<p>Worst of all for personal happiness is a malarial climate,
and, unfortunately, they are very common in this country.
The miasmatic poison is peculiarly depressing to the mind,
and is always associated with debility and despondency.
Malarial regions cannot be left uninhabited, but those
whose evil fortune it is to be condemned to dwell in them
have a heavy additional burden laid upon them in life.</p>

<hr />

<p>We are all more or less like those lower animals whose
colors change with their surroundings.</p>

<hr />

<p>Seek the open air; the fruits which grow outdoors are
alone those which ripen in season.</p>

<p>To die for our country is truly noble, when our country

<p>Love of country is sometimes a fine phrase for love of
comfort.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <span class="title">Luck and its Laws.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">When the wisest of the seven wise men of Greece was
asked to name some happy person, he cited several, all of
whom were among the dead. “And do you know none
living who is happy?” queried his royal host, who had
expected his own name to be mentioned among the fortunate
few. “Call no man happy,” replied the sage, “until
he is dead.” He forgot not that in the temples of his
native land, Tyche, Goddess of Chance, was represented
holding in one hand a rudder, for it is she who guides the
affairs of men; but in the other hand a sphere, to warn of
the instability of her favors. Like the King of Lydia,
most of her modern votaries remember her former but
forget her latter attribute.</p>

<p>Science preaches that the progress of thought has been
from a time when Caprice and Chance were deemed everything
in nature and Law was nothing, to the present day,
when Law is known to be everything and Caprice and
Chance are nothing.</p>

<p>Science may preach till it is hoarse, but there is something
in the human mind ever insisting that the ancient
Goddess, or some other inscrutable fatality, coerces the
history of the individual; and that, from his birth, luck,
good or bad, merriment or melancholy, marks him for her
<!--097.png--><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 93</span>
own. Rarely have I asked a man of large experience who
denied the mighty influence of the unforeseen and unforeseeable
in practical affairs. Some of the most extensive
enterprises are based on the recognition of this truth, and
it is mathematically demonstrable; for mathematicians are
prepared to show that disorder itself is orderly, and that
the vagaries of chance are bound by laws, and pinned in a
straight jacket of formulas.</p>

<p>But what their apparatus of signs and symbols does not
show, where it completely breaks down, is precisely the
only point of human interest in the whole matter,&mdash;in its
application to the individual life and fortunes. Averages
and general laws they give us; but it is also a mathematical
law that the average is never applicable to the individual.
What is true of the whole series is never true of any one
member of the series. No man who insured his life ever
died at the precise minute which, according to the actuary’s
tables, terminated his calculable expectation of life.</p>

<p>Let us see what, from this point of view, these computations
about luck or chance teach.</p>

<p>In mathematics they are included in the Calculus of
Probabilities, the discovery of which is attributed to Pascal.
A gambling nobleman asked him what are the chances of
turning a red or black card in cutting the pack a given
number of times. As all the cards are either red or black,
Pascal replied that it would be expressed by the formula x/2.
In ordinary language, this means that when two events are
equally probable, they will occur equally in the long run;
<!--098.png--><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 94</span>
and in practical affairs, when we neither know nor suspect
things are unequal, we must assume them to be equal.</p>

<p>On these simple principles all calculations of chances,
to be worth anything, must be based. But they are not
so simple as they sound. Pascal’s formula, like all formulas
of the higher mathematics, expresses an abstract
truth only, and one that can never be realized in fact.
The longer the run, the more certain will it be that the
two events never will occur equally; and the more frequent
will be long series of the recurrence of one or the
other.</p>

<p>Turning aside from abstruse calculations, which can be
readily found elsewhere by those who would like to see
them, let us inquire as to the practical results of this Logic
of Chance when applied to the fortunes of the individual.</p>

<p>These observed and calculated results establish the following
interesting rule:&mdash;In matters of pure luck, about
two-thirds of any given number of persons will come out
substantially even, in any large number of trials; of the
remaining third, about one-half will be noticeably lucky,
and the remaining one-half noticeably unlucky. Thus, of
six who venture, four will have no special fortune, good or
bad; one will be quite “in vein”; one quite “out of
vein.”</p>

<p>Suppose the players are thirty-six, and we select the
lucky six, and pit them against each other, as in “progressive”
games; the same law will hold good, one coming
out noticeably better, one noticeably worse than the
<!--099.png--><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 95</span>
rest; and so on indefinitely, the number of the extremes
diminishing at the rate of six to one at each new trial.</p>

<p>This is the Law of Luck; but it is obvious that it leaves
luck, good and bad, a real fact; and among a million men,
or in a great city like New York or London, we must find
extraordinary examples of “sequences,” both of the
favors and the frowns of fortune; not in gambling only,
but in those thousands of accidental events which make up
the welfare or misery of personal experience.</p>

<p>All the moralists I have read on the subject seem to
blink and stagger at this obvious and necessary conclusion,&mdash;that
the history of many individuals is and must be
enormously controlled, in spite of any efforts of their own,
by pure luck. In cutting the cards twenty times in succession,
about twenty people in a million will cut red every
time and another twenty will cut black every time; and so
it will be with all other matters of pure chance in life.
There is no use in trying to dodge this certain result of a
sum in simple division. We must count it in, in all plans
and calculations for success and happiness in our individual
life.</p>

<p>The important question is, what value must we assign to
it?</p>

<p>Here is where men make several frequent and disastrous
errors.</p>

<p>The most common is an error in arithmetic which the
little I have above said on the calculus of chance should be
enough to correct. It is putting faith in their good luck,
<!--100.png--><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 96</span>
or falling into discouragement from their bad luck. Each
is equally silly. A sequence of any kind of luck does not
offer the slightest presumption that it will continue. The
chances remain precisely as at the beginning, and are about
six to one against the continuance of either extreme in the
same individual. In matters of pure chance no sustained
coincidence in either direction adds the least probability
to its continuance. This is what is so difficult for men to
believe; and so it comes about that faith in good luck is
the source of most bad luck. A “run of good luck” has
wrecked the lives of more men than has the repetition of
disasters.</p>

<p>The reason for this is easily shown. The general rule in
life is that a man’s prosperity is conditioned closely by the
amount and kind of his knowledge, and his skill in the use
of it. But the man who “trusts to luck” distinctly renounces
the advantages of knowledge, and builds his hopes
on his acknowledged impotence to influence the results.
He abandons himself to the current of events, and makes
no effort to look forward and see whether it will suck him
into a whirlpool, or land him on some sunny shore.
Scarcely any state of mind could be fraught with greater
peril to his future.</p>

<p>We have the sayings, “dumb luck” and “a fool for
luck;” and the Italians their proverb that one must have a
little of the fool in him, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">un poco di matto</i>, to be lucky.
Most men are fools, so it is inherently probable that the
lucky man will belong to the majority; but beyond that,
<!--101.png--><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 97</span>
<em>his</em> folly is conspicuous who bases his hopes of fortune rather
on luck than on labor and forethought. The immorality
of gambling and its ruinous influence on the happiness
of life lie in the fact that it disclaims as useless every
precept which prudence, skill, and knowledge lay down as
essential to individual success.</p>

<p>It is mathematically certain that some people will have
an astonishing succession of fortunate experiences which
they have nowise aided in bringing about, ripe plums dropping
into their mouths from invisible trees. They are
popularly called “lucky fellows.” But the ancient Greeks,
with that wonderful acumen in practical affairs which was
their own, considered them peculiarly dangerous associates,
to be avoided as partners in regular business, scarcely safe
to associate with as companions. When Polycrates, King
of Samos, was crowned with such repeated successes that it
seemed as if the very gods might envy him, his friend, the
King of Egypt, advised him to throw his most precious
jewel, a wonderfully carved signet-ring, into the sea;
and when this was brought back the next day by a fisherman,
who had found it in the belly of a fish that had swallowed
it, the King of Egypt withdrew his fleet and severed
his treaty; for he knew some dreadful disaster awaited such
unheard-of fortune; and it soon came when Polycrates fell
into the hands of his enemy, and was crucified alive on the
Asian strand.</p>

<p>The story is probably a fable; but its moral is an eternal
truth. The hour of prosperity is ever dangerous; but when
<!--102.png--><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 98</span>
the prosperity has come without labor or effort or forethought,
it is nearly always fatal. Unexpected success
enervates the will and fosters illusions of the mind. The
ancients represented the goddess Fortuna as proffering a
cup of intoxicating wine to her favorites. Either they
recognize their success as the result of pure chance, and
persuade themselves that they are fortune’s favorite children,
and can safely hazard any risks; or their vanity leads
them to attribute what was the result of chance to their own
miraculous sagacity, and they thus magnify to a dangerous
degree their own capacities. Either conclusion leads them
surely on the downward road to ruin.</p>

<p>Nowhere is this mental debility which seizes the
believers in luck more absurdly shown than in the return
to primeval superstition which it brings with it. The
gambler, in his faith in caprice and chance, sinks to the
level of the primitive savage, and accepts the superstitions
of that level with equal readiness. The most cultivated
habitué of Monte Carlo has his fetishes; he watches for
signs and omens; he is as much the slave of auspicious or
inauspicious auguries as an Australian cannibal. Pitiable
retrogression of the human intellect! What absurdity will
he not commit to “break the run of the luck” when it is
against him! He will turn his chair thrice around; he will
avoid playing if a red-whiskered man opposite him
stakes; he will go to his hotel and change his coat. He
knows that every principle of right reason and sound logic
teaches that events cannot be modified by actions in no
<!--103.png--><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 99</span>
way relating to them, but he quietly renounces reason
and logic as his guides!</p>

<p>Surely no man who is engaged in the intelligent pursuit
of happiness will put himself in that position! I do not
forget the pleasure of the game. That will be considered
on a later page. But there is no need to argue that a
pleasure which leads to the habitual disregard of reason as
a monitor cannot be trusted as a permanent contributor to
happiness.</p>

<p>One important practical point remains to be noted.
Neither in the gambling room, nor outside, is there half so
much mere luck in affairs as most people imagine. The
cards are stacked, the dice are loaded, the balls are
weighted. Only the gulls believe the game is fair. Shrewd
men in business transactions like to conceal their hands,
and persuade their clients and associates that much is the
result of accident which they themselves have brought
about. The plan has many advantages, and plays successfully
on the most responsive chords of human weakness.
It is said that the late Baron Rothschild of London
declined to embark in an enterprise unless its promoters
were known as lucky men. Do not imagine that he was
governed by any foolish superstition. He knew, perhaps
better than any one, what is the real significance of
constant luck in the stock market; and would have been
the last to have accepted it in the sense of the guileless
gambler.</p>

<p>Much that in the lives of others we are apt to attribute
<!--104.png--><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 100</span>
to luck turns out on closer examination to be the natural
though infrequent result of certain cultivated qualities. I
have heard of several persons who have had handsome
legacies left them by strangers in unexpected acknowledgment
of kindness shown. Uniform courtesy is almost sure
to be followed sooner or later by some such reward.
People who are what we call “quick-witted,” whose judgment
is cool and action prompt, are apt to be lucky even
in misfortune. William of Normandy, landing for the
conquest of England, tripped and fell on the sand. It
was an evil presage, and his soldiers shrank back in terror.
But William, seizing a handful of the soil, cried&mdash;“Thus I
grasp this earth, and, by the splendor of God, I shall keep
it.” With this he turned the gloomy portent into one
the most auspicious. Moderate luck with good sense will
repair any blunder, while folly will spoil the best of
chances. “Fortune favors the bold,” simply because
they have the courage to act; but she rarely favors them
when they act without knowledge and prudence. When
Shakespeare in the familiar passage says, “There is a tide
in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood leads on to
fortune,” he assumes that the fortunate man knows when
flood-tide arrives.</p>

<p>As we are thus often deceived in the lives of others, so we
are almost as frequently the dupes of our own experience.
It is not easy to decide, concerning our successes and
failures, which are owing to luck and which to ourselves.
Confucius advises those who fail to follow the example of
<!--105.png--><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 101</span>
the archer when he misses the <a name="chg2" id="chg2"></a>target, and examine first the
instruments employed, and then themselves, as the cause
of failure is likely to be in one or the other. Some minds
are more exhilarated by gains than they are depressed by
losses; others deplore losses more keenly than they enjoy
successes; few estimate both at a just relative value.</p>

<p>Even the very unlucky should feel some cheerfulness
when he reflects how in modern times we have learned to
conciliate the Fates, and compel even the most adverse
destiny to drop the ugliest of its masks. This we accomplish
through the various forms of <em>insurance</em>, all of them
based on the study of the very caprices of Fortune herself.
Marvelous example of mind setting at nought the threats
of brute nature! The very disasters before which our
ancestors bowed most hopeless and most helpless, are those
whose attacks we dread the least. Hail and lightning,
storms on the ocean and fire in populous cities, we read
about with small concern providing our property is well
insured. By the same process we can protect our children
from poverty and our own old age from want. Beneficent
discovery, which in its varied forms has added incalculably
to the happiness of man by freeing him from the
terrors of the unknown, and providing him with a shield
behind which he can afford to smile at the gloomiest
frowns of Fate!</p>

<p>Subtler than any beast of the field is man, and filled
with Promethean courage to rob the gods themselves!
But behind the impenetrable veil, through which he sees
<!--106.png--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 102</span>
not even darkly, are powers who smile in derision at his
attempts to free himself from their eternal mastery. No
logic can explain and no calculus compute the workings of
their mysterious ways. Against the elemental wrath of fire
and water man can guard himself; but against the results
of the most thoughtless of his words or the slightest of his
actions he has no protection, for he has not and cannot
form the least idea of their consequences. Here Destiny
rules undisputed and supreme.</p>

<p>Such reflections led the great Goethe in his old age to
dwell more and more on the illimitable influence of trifling
events, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bedeutende Kleinigkeiten</i>. Dull critics have misunderstood
and some of the dullest have even made merry
about his insistence on this pivotal truth in the history of
every individual and in that of the world. The fate of
nations has ever been decided by the most trivial occurrences.
Cæsar, going to the Senate, refused to read a
letter which was handed him, saying, “Business for to-morrow.”
Had he opened it, the greatest empire that ever
was would have had a different story to transmit to a different
posterity. One summer morning the pretty Arleta,
daughter of a Norman butcher, tripped down to the brook
to wash her mother’s soiled linen. Had she waited a few
minutes later, Robert the Devil would have already passed,
and neither their son, the bastard William of Normandy,
nor his thousands of knights would have set their iron
heels on English soil. Louis <a name="chg3" id="chg3"></a><abbr title="Sixteen">XVI</abbr> stops at St. Ménéhould
to eat a pig’s foot, and the great and famous line of
<!--107.png--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 103</span>
the Bourbons of France is extinguished by that single
dish.</p>

<p>These are celebrated examples. But the thoughtful man
will recognize in his own life and in the lives of those
around him how they have been altered, directed, completely
transformed by such slightest of incidents. His
decision to pursue this or that avocation, that as to where
he should settle, the first meeting with her who is his
wife, the conversation which led to such or such an investment
of the first importance, these, the most momentous
actions of his life, turned on such casual and insignificant
incidents that it makes him shiver to think of it! In such
moments he is ready to exclaim,</p>

<p>The prime motors of the thought of the world have not
been the ponderous tomes of schoolmen nor the decrees of
councils and universities. What, asks a philosophical historian,
were the two most important events in the intellectual
history of England during the seventeenth century?
The Paradise Lost? The King James’ Version? No. One
was the commitment of a strolling tinker to Bedford Jail; the
other the decision of a distempered youth to make himself
a coat of leather and go to live in a hollow tree. The one
gave us the “Pilgrim’s Progress;” the other the immortal
doctrine that faith, the true faith, “finds center everywhere,”
and cares not to fix itself in form.</p>

<p>“Slaves of Chance!” Of Chance? Have I the right
<!--108.png--><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 104</span>
word? Is it Chance which through millions of years has
steadily guided the increasing purpose which runs through
all nature, which has multiplied the organs of animals and
widened the minds of men with the progress of the suns;
which has disabled the armies of kings by the weaponless
words of a peasant; which has confounded wisdom by folly
and foiled strength by weakness; never anywhere losing
sight of the goal, unseen of men but surely divined,
toward which tends the Motion of the World?</p>

<p>Chance? No. But by what other name shall I name it?
Shall I take refuge in the jargon of the pulpit and call these
“special providences?” Helpless evasion of the question!
Impotent effort to distinguish between the special and the
general designs of the Designer, obscuring the one central
point to be kept in sight, that the special is the general
and the general the special.</p>

<p>But why seek a name? A name becomes a fetish as much
as a stock or a stone, and men bow down to it and worship
it with as much abasement of their better natures.
Enough, if in the fates of mighty nations and in each
lightest act of the individual life we recognize the same
Directing Force, invisible but nowise unintelligible, rather
speaking with sun-clear words to our enlightened reason of
conscious purpose and definite intention, to which the
iron laws of Nature and the wild vagaries of Chance are
ductile instruments and obedient servants.</p>

<p>This is the ultimate expression of abstract science and
of that solid philosophy which is built on the inductive
<!--109.png--><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 105</span>
study of both nature and man. Its lesson to the individual
is, that he is neither the helpless creature of necessity nor
the slave of chance; that he is master of his immediate
action, but of its consequences he is not master; that there
are unseen forces at work arranging the incidents and
accidents of his life, and these forces he can in no wise
control; but if he is alert and diligent they cannot
entangle his own individuality in the mesh of events, he
can rise superior to them, can be <em>himself</em>, and win
happiness to some degree in any surroundings; and he
may go forward in the sublime and certain confidence that
his existence is an essential part of an eternal plan, which
asks neither faith nor authority for its recognition, for it is
the logical condition of the very reason by which he
knows that he is Himself and not another.</p>

<p>The calculus of probabilities has already destroyed the

<p>Fortune-tellers are put in jail because they deceive; they
should be hanged, did they tell the truth. How dull were
life, could it be read ahead! Only a weak nature, such as
his, would say with Hartley Coleridge, “Happiness is the
exclusion of all <em>hap</em>, that is, chance.” More virile are the
<!--110.png--><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 106</span>
words of Charles James Fox, inveterate gambler that he
was, “The next best thing to winning is to lose.” The
uncertainty of the future is the only stimulus to exertion,
and its obscurity is the source of our chief delights.</p>

<hr />

<p>Always expect a change of luck. Then, if it is from
good to bad, you will be prepared for it; and if from bad
to good, you will have enjoyed the pleasure of expecting
it, as well as its arrival.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Give your son luck and throw him in the sea,” says a
Spanish proverb.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are men who succeed through their misfortunes
rather than their good fortunes.</p>

<hr />

<p>People regard bad luck as a kind of injustice. They
secretly say with Louis XIV, when his armies were defeated
in Flanders, “Has God forgotten all I have done for
Him?”</p>

<hr />

<p>The ancients reckoned a man’s luck, good or bad,
among the gifts with which he is endowed by nature.</p>

<p><!--111.png--><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 107</span></p>
<hr />

<p>In very strong characters there is something which
eludes analysis and defies definition, the very goad of
destiny, driving them on their allotted paths with unrelenting
and inevitable impulse. This is what the ancient
Greeks, and among the moderns especially Goethe, recognized
as the “demonic force.” It endows a life with
dramatic unity and historic completeness.</p>

<hr />

<p>Fate lies in fetters, so she no longer rules the stage.</p>

<hr />

<p>The folly of some men turns out better than the foresight

<p>With Courage and Civility as allies you can often take
captive Good-luck.</p>

<hr />

<p>He who has well considered all the chances is prepared
for the worst.</p>

<hr />

<p>Because one cannot see ahead clearly, should he put out

<p>The captain who prefers trusting to luck to taking an
observation is not the man to sail with.</p>

willing to lose. The player who will not sacrifice his
pawns will soon have his king in check.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">PART <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></h3>

<p class="center muchlarger">How far our Happiness depends
on Ourselves.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <span class="title">Our Occupations, those of Necessity and those
of Choice.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">In one of his novels, Emile Zola describes a conversation
between the workwomen of a Parisian laundry. The
subject was, what each would do if she had ten thousand
francs a year. They were all of one mind. They would
do just nothing at all!</p>

<p>This washerwoman’s ideal of happiness has also commended
itself to various philosophic minds. “I have
often said,” writes Pascal, “that all misfortunes befall
men because they do not know enough to stay quietly in
their own rooms.” What puzzled him was that men will
make the most toilsome efforts to secure a period of repose;
and as soon as they obtain it, they weary of it and demand
action. He might have learned from this the fallacy of
his own definition.</p>

<p><!--114.png--><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 110</span>
The genial Herder taught that simplicity and repose are
the two valves of the shell that secretes the pearl of human
felicity; but he neglected to add that it must be the simplicity
of aims combined with a multiplicity of means;
and repose enjoyed merely as a preparation for renewed
activity.</p>

<p>The true doctrine is that Labor, systematic, effective,
congenial Labor, is not only a necessity, it is the source of
the highest enjoyment to men. The ancients were right
when they said the gods sell all pleasures at the price of
toil. “Function in healthful action” is the definition
which the modern physiologist gives of the feeling of
pleasure; and he but translates into prose the poetic
expression of the old Greek. The elements of true happiness
must be sought in activity, not in repose; and it is
high time that the world and the wiseacres found it out,
and ceased singing peans to idleness and cursing the necessity
of work.</p>

<p>Most men and a great many women have to work for
their living. They usually accept the necessity with discontent
and with envy of those who are idle or are in
other pursuits. The farmer thinks he would have done
better to have gone to the city. The lawyer regrets that
he did not study medicine. As in Dr. Johnson’s story:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Surely,” said Rasselas, “the wise men to whom we
listen with reverence chose that mode of life for themselves
which they thought most likely to make them happy.”</p>

<p>“Very few,” replied the poet, “live by choice. Every
<!--115.png--><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 111</span>
man is placed in his present condition by causes which
acted without his foresight, and with which he did not
always co-operate.”</p>

<p>In this country most men select for themselves the occupation
which they pursue for a livelihood; but I doubt
whether the freedom in their choice makes them more contented
with it. The root of their discontent lies deeper
than is suggested in Dr. Johnson’s philosophic tale, and
its removal, so indispensable to personal happiness, must
be sought for elsewhere than in still wider license of
choosing.</p>

<p>So far as either happiness or success is concerned it
makes no difference, in nine cases out of ten, what business
or profession a young man adopts, so that it is suitable to
his education and social position. The rare exceptions
are where there is some strong natural bent or aptitude; and
even then the pursuit of it is more likely to bring enjoyment
than money. Men are about equally fitted by nature
for all the ordinary avocations of life, and the choice of a
business is less important than is generally believed.</p>

<p>That is not where the secret of success and happiness
lies. It lies in learning to practice one’s trade or profession
as an art, to like it for its own sake, to derive a considerable
portion of our pleasure from its pursuit, to have, as the
French say, our heart in it, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avoir le cœur au métier</i>. But
how is this possible, one will ask, with the drudgery of the
counting house, or the mill, or the harvest field, or the
Court of Quarter Sessions? It is possible with any avocation,
<!--116.png--><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 112</span>
if one will take the trouble to think about it as one
of the manifold branches of human industry, to study its
relations to other branches and to the lives and fates of
human beings, to try to improve it, and to learn its attractions
for those who do like it, and endeavor to enter into
their feelings. Every occupation has some such attractions
and some such possibilities. Those who are willing to see
and seize them are those who derive both solid enjoyment
and substantial rewards from their work.</p>

<p>Another secret lies in the cultivation of a sort of analogy
or harmony between our mental disposition and the occurrences
and surroundings in which our obligatory labor
places us. This is quite within our own power to effect
by the voluntary control of our thoughts. Why busy our
imaginations and disturb our minds with dreaming of the
pleasures of foreign travel when we know we have to stay
at home and work ten hours a day? Far better occupy
ourselves with the interests around us and the easily attainable
pleasures within our reach. Have no fear that this
course is narrowing or lowering. There are no nobler
games than those which can be played on any village lawn,
and the hyssop on your garden wall, could you read it,
would teach you the laws of all organic nature.</p>

<p>The considerations which should have weight in the
choice of avocation are less those of capacity or inclination,
since these differ little and can readily be cultivated, than
those referred to on an earlier page which relate to health,
bodily and mental. It is not necessary to be very clever
<!--117.png--><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 113</span>
to succeed in business; only a little more clever than those
around you. But it is necessary to have your health; for
in the struggle for bread, the weak are thrust to the wall
without remorse. No one who chooses wisely will select a
business which will aggravate an hereditary or acquired
malady. It is more satisfactory to be honor-man of a
lower class, than come in at the tail-end of a higher one.</p>

<p>There are also certain mental disqualifications which
apply especially to the professions. William Hazlitt objected
to all professions which depend on reputation,
because this is “as often got without merit as lost without
deserving;” but this is less the case now than it was
formerly. The point is rather a mental unfitness for the
work required, a state of things which may exist with
plenty of ability. The politician with an instinctive
shrinking from publicity, the lawyer who has an aversion
to argument, the physician who is unable to show sympathy
and interest where he feels none, may succeed in his profession,
but he will scarcely enjoy it.</p>

<p>Intense application to an occupation is a common cause
of distaste for it and unhappiness in it. Such concentration
is nearly always needless, and is often fruitless. The
most brilliant fortunes have not been the products of hard
work, but of shrewd planning. The sweetness of the
chimes does not depend on the violence of the ringing,
but on the skill of the bellman. I had a friend who was
brought up a broker, but remained a philosopher. He
used to say that energy in business is the most common
<!--118.png--><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 114</span>
cause of failures. He referred, of course, to that exclusive
and persistent zeal which is pretty sure to end by enfeebling
the body and exhausting the mind.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with one’s lot sometimes arises from over
conscientiousness,&mdash;a rare disease, I confess, in business
circles, but I have met a few cases of it. “Always try to
do your best,” is one of several hundred copy-book
maxims which hypocrisy pretends are necessary to success,
but which common sense and practical life quietly ignore.
Very much less than your best will often answer the purpose,
and the rope that reaches is long enough. I have
witnessed considerable distress, especially among young
men, because their books of account were not so immaculate,
or their press-articles so studied, as they might have
been by greater toil; yet they were good enough,&mdash;and
good enough is good.</p>

<p>At the best, making one’s living is often a sad affair.
Business life is like a dinner at a crowded third-rate hotel,
&mdash;one’s clothing is so torn in the struggle for place, and
there is so much dirt to eat before the dessert is served,
that either the appetite turns to nausea, or its satisfaction is
followed by indigestion. Hence so many able men prefer
permanent positions on small salaries to embarking in
affairs on their own account. Many a lawyer will give up
a large practice to become a judge on one-third of the
income. Politics in the United States is, as a business,
notoriously unsafe, but the attraction of fixed salaries
overcrowds it with aspirants. The dream of the Socialists
<!--119.png--><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 115</span>
is for all citizens to be salaried. Individual effort, however,
alone insures general progress; not to dispense with
it, but to favor its pleasurable development, is the real
social problem.</p>

<p>The true aim of Occupations of Necessity is to provide us
time, not for repose and inaction, as most moralists teach,
but for Occupations of Choice. We call these our recreations,
amusements, pastimes, favorite studies, hobbies, fads,
if you please. In these lie the mainsprings of our felicity;
and their character reveals pretty clearly the measure of
our capacity for happiness, and the degree of our mastery
of its theory. If we pass our leisure in cultivating delusions
and pursuing inanities, our enjoyment is that of the
insane and the idiotic, and arises not from the health, but
from the disease or debility, of our minds. Yet how many
men, skillful in securing the means of pleasure, are witless
in the use of it!</p>

<p>“Those are the best recreations,” says old Thomas
Fuller, “which, besides refreshing, enable men to some
other good ends.” His words, though they sound well,
are only half-wise. To enjoy to the utmost any favorite
pastime or study, it should be pursued for itself alone, and
with no ulterior purpose or hope in view. “’Twere to
cramp its use, to hook it to some useful end.” Pleasure is
nobler than profit, enjoyment is higher than utility, whatever
political economists or pulpit orators say to the contrary.
I know some men who always explain their relaxations
as a part of their serious lives; and others who, if
<!--120.png--><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 116</span>
detected in an act of benevolence, hasten to show that it
was prompted by their self-interest; of the two, I admire
the latter more.</p>

<p>A contented spirit is merely one which pleases itself with

<p>For most, it will be easier to learn to like what they have

<p class="p2">There are some prayers which belong to the universal
Religion of Humanity, and none more so than this, which
is found in the oldest <a name="chg4" id="chg4"></a>prayer-book of the Aryan race, the
Rig Veda,&mdash;“O Lord, prosper us in the getting and the
keeping!” “To make money” is certainly the “soul’s
sincere desire” of most citizens of the world at the present
day, and nowhere is it more fervently uttered than in this
country.</p>

<p>This is no discredit. So far as we can trace the history
of man from the Old Stone Age upward, the one efficient
motive to his progress has been the acquisition and
preservation of property. This has been the immediate
aim of all his arts and institutions and the chief incentive
to individual exertion. The time may come&mdash;indeed, there
are signs of its approach&mdash;when nations will consciously
aim at some other than a property career, and individuals
will perceive that the purpose of riches is something else
than to offer facilities for their further increase or for
inglorious ease.</p>

<p>In this devotion to the accumulation of property men
have not been led astray by what Shakespeare so magnificently
calls<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

Material resources are the indispensable requisites to
progress. The miseries of poverty are manifest, and there
are none greater. The utterly poor man is condemned to
servitude and suffering, the woman to degradation. The
imperative demands of the animal wants quench the
finer elements of character, and the brutal stamps out the
human in the desperate struggle for existence.</p>

<p>What wonder that the pauper turns in bestial fury
against the rich, who flaunt before him a superfluous
luxury? But his passion springs from his ignorance.</p>

<p>Wealth is no longer “spoils,” the product of robbery;
rather may it be called the reward paid by society for
services rendered humanity. It is frequently the booty
won in some victory over the elements of nature or of self,
and by the practice of those maxims which make men
stronger and more useful to those around them. To the
possessor it supplies the leisure necessary to the cultivation
of his nobler faculties and to the highest of duties&mdash;self-development.</p>

<p>The terms “wealth” and “riches” are vague, and to
understand the relation of property to personal happiness,
which is my present theme, we must define them closer.</p>

<p>The time has gone by when either love is satisfied to
live in “a cot beside the hill,” or a philosopher in a tub.
Both prefer to possess a house in a city street and a
cottage by the sea; which is a sign that both the
philosophy of love and the love of philosophy have
improved. The affectation of despising riches&mdash;which
<!--124.png--><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 120</span>
never was anything but an affectation&mdash;is no longer good
form, even among sages.</p>

<p>Let us count what riches give.</p>

<p>The list is short and it is pleasant reading. Riches supply
us with the food and drink we like, clothing, shelter,
and surroundings to our taste, means of warmth and light,
the services and to some extent the companionship of those
we choose, and especially leisure and means to pursue our
“occupations of choice.”</p>

<p>These are the immediate benefits we derive from riches,
and practically there are none others. Political economists
have therefore called these “real” or “effective” riches,
to distinguish them from “potential” or “productive”
riches, by which latter they mean property or capital
invested with the object of supplying “effective” riches,
without personal effort on the part of the owner.</p>

<p>In looking over the list of “effective” riches, one sees
that they are all very desirable, and perhaps, I may as well
say, essential to personal happiness. I am sure nine-tenths
of the civilized world will agree with me. About that, the
discussion will be short; but about how to obtain them,
that inquiry is not to be disposed of so quickly.</p>

<p>We are now talking business. Let us be practical. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
affaires avant tout.</i> Just how much a year do I need to be
rich? Here I make an extraordinary discovery, comparable
only to that of the Fortunate Isles, where apple trees
bore fruits of gold; or the valley of Sinbad the Sailor,
where the common pebbles were rubies and diamonds. On
<!--125.png--><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 121</span>
turning to that list of “effective” riches, I perceive that
very little of it has to do with <em>things</em>, and very much of
it with <em>me</em>. It is based on what <em>I</em> like, prefer, choose. If,
like the Emperor Nero, I cannot be satisfied with less than
peacocks’ brains and nightingales’ tongues for dinner, I
must have the revenues of an empire; but if I am content
with bread and beans, with a shanty to keep out the wind
and a slop-shop suit for warmth, then a few fifty-cent fees
a day&mdash;I happen to be a doctor&mdash;will make me rich as
a Rothschild.</p>

<p>Marvelous discovery! beatific vision! only, at the
moment of utmost complacency, calm reflection, like a
chill wind, “disencharms the late enchantment.” My
tastes are not my own. They belong to my parents and
my race. I cannot help it that I was born with a thin
skin, which requires fine silk next it to be comfortable;
with a queasy stomach, that demands delicate dishes; with
a thirst for remote and useless learning, which must have
expensive books. So from this time forth I flout at and
deride that solemn prig of antiquity, whose name I am
glad to have forgotten, who taught that there are two ways
of getting rich, each equally satisfactory, but one much
easier than the other&mdash;the one to diminish our wants, the
other to increase our incomes. I have no better opinion
of his teaching than had Malvolio of the doctrine of Pythagoras,
that “the soul of his grandam might haply inhabit
a partridge;” and, really, which of the two the antiquated
<!--126.png--><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 122</span>
mentor thought the easier I cannot imagine. To me, it
has been the latter.</p>

<p>Money, therefore, we must have.</p>

<p>Her physician said of Cleopatra that she had “pursued
conclusions infinite, of easy ways to die.” The expression
might be used of many a modern schemer with reference
to getting wealth. But alas! I am afraid, of the thousands
of schemes, that of the dry, unimaginative, political
economists is the only one worth mentioning; and that is
summed up in the hateful word&mdash;Economize! or, as they
put it in their stiff dialect,&mdash;“Diminish the consumption
of your 'effective’ riches, in order that you may add the
surplus to your 'productive’ riches, or invested capital.”</p>

<p>Some of them are even meddlesome enough to lay down
exact rules as to how much one should put aside from an
annual income and securely invest, in order to meet the
demands of what they call “an enlightened prudence.”
This, they say, should be one-fourth of such income, and
they add that if this with its increment is continued for
about five-and-twenty years, the return from your “productive”
riches will then be sufficient to supply you with
the amount of “effective” riches to which you have been
accustomed, without further labor on your part; and you
can quietly sit in the chimney corner and live in bliss all
the rest of your days, like the prince in the fairy story.
This is a page, therefore, good for young married people
to read who are starting out in life and have their fortunes
to make, and want to “retire” at their silver wedding.</p>

Such slow work will not suit the energetic young man
whose determination is to get rich quick and have a good
time while he is about it. He has no occasion to go back
to antiquity for his two ways of succeeding, and he proposes
to use them both as strings to his bow, so that by one
or the other he will drive his arrow into the bull’s eye of
fortune’s target. Speculation! Advertising! These are the
words of power with which he will enslave the spirits which
guard the hidden pots of gold. He is well aware that a
bit of red flannel is bait enough for many fishes, and that
in angling false flies catch more trout than real ones. The
value of knowledge to him is measured by the ability it
gives to detect the ignorance of others and to take advantage
of it. His plans, like those of Cardinal de Retz, are
so laid that, though they fail, they will bring in some return.
He will manage to secure a commission even on the expenditures
he makes for his pleasures. Such a character, and
there are many such in our country, often enough succeeds
in his ambitions.</p>

business man who pretends otherwise is either a hypocrite
or of dull moral sense.</p>

<p>In this race for riches, whether along the peaceful avenue
of economy or jostling in the streets of speculation, where
comes in the Pursuit of Happiness? Riches, as I have
shown, are and can be nothing more than means to this
end, and those who, through avarice, greed, or rapacity,
make them the end and aim of their aspirations, trade
gold for dross. Scarcely less is the error of those who are
ever postponing the hour of enjoyment until a certain sum
is reached, and their fortune can be rounded off with
additional thousands. It is a general tendency in human
nature to live in the past or the future, although the
present alone is man’s. What to him is <em>now</em>, and <em>here</em>, is
all that he can ever possess or enjoy; and if you ask him,
he will grant it; but he is driven ever by what seems an
irrational and demonic power to seek his joy in what is
somewhere else, far off, out of reach, impossible of attainment,
beyond his capacities.</p>

<p>The illusive pictures drawn by memory, by hope,
and by imagination have their proper place in the palace
of Human Happiness; but the majority fix their gaze steadily
on these alone, and wander through halls and chambers
filled with rich stuffs and costly ware, through corridors
looking out on entrancing views and courts opening to the
starry heavens, their eyes fixed vacantly on the far distance,
and noting nothing of the beauties by which they are surrounded.
To waken them by some whisper of what they

are missing, and to persuade them to turn their eyes on

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <span class="title">The Pleasures we may Derive from our
Senses.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">The odious doctrine of the ascetics has been that whatever
is agreeable to man is offensive to God; and that to cultivate
the pleasurable sensations is to prepare one’s self for
perdition.</p>

<p>Far more sane than they was that Mohammedan teacher
quoted by Gibbon, who, when asked to describe the true
believers, replied,&mdash;“<em>They</em> are the elect of God, whose
lives are devoted to the improvement of their own natural
faculties.”</p>

<p>As mistaken as the ascetics, are those wooden-souled
disciplinarians who maintain that we should not look for
recreation in our daily work, but put off the thoughts of it
to holidays and vacations. These are but one degree
better than those hypocrites who will tell you that benevolence
should have no place in business, and who will offer
you a round sum for a public charity, while they squeeze
the salaries of their shop-girls down to the lowest quarter-of-a-dollar.</p>

<p>Down with such imposters! Each hour of our lives is
the best hour for enjoying ourselves and for providing
others the means of enjoyment; and there is no better
<!--133.png--><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 129</span>
way to accomplish both these objects than that suggested
by the pious Arab,&mdash;“The improvement of our own
natural faculties.”</p>

<p>These have been divided by experts in such matters into
three classes,&mdash;the Sensations, the Emotions, and the Intellect.
I shall consider the training of each with reference
to the special pleasures it can furnish. All are equally
worth cultivating. The delights of one are not lower than
those of another, if accepted in the proper spirit. He
who has right self-culture will derive gratification from
them all; and will not be, like the French peasant in
Halevy’s story, unable to understand how heaven could be
attractive unless his native village were transported there.</p>

<p>Some general rules must be respected if the exercise of
any of our faculties is to yield the maximum of pleasure.
These rules are derived from the physiology of the nervous
system; for it cannot be doubted that this underlies, if it
is not identical with, every feeling and function of the
mind.</p>

<p>I hasten to say this, lest the reader should suppose they
are derived from moral philosophy, or based on duty or
virtue. I am well aware they could expect a scant hearing
were this the case. Men dislike as much to be urged to
their good, as to be forbidden what is hurtful. Nor are
they difficult to understand; but this helps little; it is
easy enough to learn and to teach wisdom; to apply it to
our own conduct is what is hard.</p>

<p>The first rule is that of Moderation. Restrain the indulgence
<!--134.png--><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 130</span>
in any one pleasure. Immoderation is sure to be
followed by exhaustion of the nerve-fibres and subsequent
painful reaction. We should not think highly of a gardener
who when he picks his flowers pulls his plants up by
the roots. Yet this is the fashion in which many men
treat their own faculties.</p>

<p>The second rule is that of Variety. Multiply the sources
and kinds of pleasure. Increase the susceptibility of all
your faculties to its sweet appeals. Seek it in all directions
immediately around you. But do not confound the
love of variety with instability and freakishness; nor
imitate those prodigals who throw the bottle away after the
first sip of its contents:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

</div><!--end container-->

<p>There are other rules; but to recite them would make
this page as dull as a sermon, and it would have as little
effect. These two are the chief, and they supplement each
other; for he who indulges moderately in all his pleasures
will have the capacity to indulge in many, and will preserve
those features which are the most desirable in all,&mdash;fineness
of Quality and persistence of Duration. He will
deal with his faculties as a good government with its
subjects,&mdash;whose aim is not to make a few extremely
happy, but to provide for all a fair share of enjoyment,
without making any miserable.</p>

<p>The most general sense we possess is that which is called
the “muscular” sense. This it is which yields the pleasurable
<!--135.png--><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 131</span>
feeling in exercise, in athletic sports, in rowing,
riding, dancing, and what old Thomas Fuller called “the
descants on the plain air of walking.” Through it we
gain the sensation of buoyancy and elasticity, we “feel
good,” our personality is sharpened, and our appreciation
of life and what it has to offer is heightened. It is the
synonym of healthful activity, and thus becomes the most
advantageous preparation for all species of enjoyment.</p>

<p>By physiologists, this muscular sense is not included in
the list of “special” senses, because it cannot be localized
in any one set of nerves. It is nearest allied to the special
sense of Touch, which is centred in certain “tactile corpuscles,”
distributed irregularly beneath the skin, principally
on the finger-tips. They are extremely useful, but
not prominently serviceable in the production of pleasurable
sensations. The stroking of soft and warm substances,
such as velvet and fur, excites agreeable impressions, but
they are not very keen. Irritations to the skin are a
source of acute annoyance, but their removal affords
merely a negatively acceptable condition.</p>

<p>When we consider how slightly most sensations of touch
excite subjective states of mind, it is remarkable that in
response to one stimulant they are among the most powerful
known in nature. This stimulus is that of another personality.
The most positive feelings of both aversion and
attraction are those excited by physical contact of the
naked flesh. This is why it has been accepted in so many
countries as a sign and proof of amity. The savage
<!--136.png--><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 132</span>
Africans touch noses and the civilized European shakes
hands or kisses the hand or the cheek. Such actions are
barren conventionalities, unaccompanied by either pleasure
or pain; but they are indeed unfortunate who cannot recall
any moment of heart’s utmost joy and triumph when “the
spirits rushed together at the touching of the lips.” Such
moments are sacred, priceless gifts of the gods, not to be
had for gold nor secured by taking thought, so their consideration
has no place in this book.</p>

<p>In spite of the active business done at the perfumery
counters, the pleasures of the sense of Smell do not seem
to come in for a large share of admiration in the modern
world. It was different in the days of old. They were
considered the most delightful of all, even to Divinity
itself. Among the earliest rites of religion was that of
burning aromatic incense to the gods; and in the books of
Moses good works are described as affording “a sweet
savor of satisfaction” to the Almighty. One of the
Fathers of the Church speaks of a holy prayer as “the
perfume of a just soul” rising to Heaven; and when a
good man passed away he was said to die “in the odor of
sanctity.” Such solemn authorities should justify the cultivation
of the pleasures of this sense. They could be
supported by abundant quotations from those philosophers,
the poets, who have much to say about “the spicy gales
of Araby the blest,” and other such odoriferous associations.</p>

<p>Some odors are as intoxicating as wine, and others cling
to the memory like the impressions of childhood. Yet it
<!--137.png--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 133</span>
is rare for the insane to have delusions of the olfactory
sense; and I have found few persons who dream of odors.
Some writers who claim to be scientific have set up “a
gamut of scents,” and others pretend such a harmonic
scale can be made the basis of a sort of music of perfumes.
This is riding theory beyond sight of practice; but
who does not inhale with conscious joy the balsamic
fragrance of the pines, the salt and stimulating whiffs
from old ocean, or the laden redolence from gardens of
roses?</p>

<p>Many writers attribute the pleasure which tobacco gives
to its influence on the sense of smell; but this, I am sure,
will not explain the intense satisfaction which it yields to
men in all climes, consuming it in so many varied ways.
I know nothing in physiology more surprising or more
puzzling than the eager demand for this plant, which sprang
up throughout the world after its discovery in America.
I have been a smoker from boyhood, and am just as unable
to analyze the pleasure it gives me as to explain it in
others.</p>

<p>That prince of epicures, Brillat-Savarin, spent some time
in the United States, and in his delightful volume on the
<cite>Physiology of the Taste</cite> has a chapter on “cookery in
America,”&mdash;which is filled with nothing but asterisks and
interrogation points!</p>

<p>A hundred years have passed since he was among us, and
we have reformed our cuisine indifferently, though not
altogether. We have been too much hampered by fatuous
<!--138.png--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 134</span>
bigots preaching that we should eat to live, and not live to
eat; whereas we should most certainly live to eat during
two or three hours out of every twenty-four; and so doing
we shall be passing them more creditably than do most men,
or probably ourselves, the remainder of the day. The
game of “beggar your neighbor” has advocates enough
and fervent disciples, so I shall have something to say
about eating for the fun of it and as a fine art.</p>

<p>All nations of culture have connected a certain solemn
joy with the act of taking food. To “break bread” with
one is the expression of the sweet sentiment of hospitality,
and for the lovers to share the same loaf before the High
Priest was the simple and beautiful marriage-rite among
the ancient Romans. The “love feasts” of the early
Christians were the repetitions of the only ceremony which
their Founder prescribed; and science traces to appropriate
nutrition the growth of both physical and mental abilities.
The devout Novalis called meal-times the “flower-seasons
of the day,” and claimed that all spiritual joys can be
expressed through the service of the table. Can there be
anything in it unworthy or debasing?</p>

<p>In the light of such declaration should we look on our
food-taking, and not merely as feeding and filling. Were
the kitchen more of a studio in American homes, we
should see a higher style of art in the drawing-rooms.
The worst preparation for a day’s work is a poor breakfast,
and its shabbiest reward is a bad dinner. If our daughters
studied more diligently what the Italians call the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">melodia</i>
<!--139.png--><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 135</span>
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">del gusto</i>, their married lives would be attuned to a more
harmonious accord.</p>

<p>Consider the appointments and symmetry of a well-served
dinner in that high style of art which the French
have brought to perfection. The mere sight of the table
awakens our esthetic feelings, disperses the cares that have
infested the day, and softens the asperities which its rude
conflicts have developed. The snowy cloth with its
embroidered centre-piece, bearing a vase of roses or restful
green; the gay triumphs of the potter’s skill, flanked by
polished metal and diaphanous crystal, whose varied forms
hint of the manifold gifts of the grape; the chairs, so
disposed as to suggest how we should live our whole lives&mdash;ever
near to others, but not jostling them. Then how
rhythmical the progress of the repast! the cold, salt shellfish,
followed by the hot and spicy soup, harmonized by
the neutral flavor of the fish, its creamy sauce relieved by
the bare suspicion of the clean acid of the lemon; and so
on through the courses, until the aromatic coffee and the
tiny glass of liqueur, redolent of wild herbs or of Alpine
flowers, remove both thoughts of food and sense of satiety.</p>

<p>The sequence of such a repast is not a conventionality.
Medical men as well as epicures know that it is based on
physiology. Once, with a friend of like inquiring mind,
I ordered a dinner at a restaurant of renown, exactly reversing
the usual sequence, beginning with Chartreuse,
coffee, and ice-cream, ending with soup, oysters, and hock.
The experiment convinced us that the received is the right
<!--140.png--><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 136</span>
sequence, and we made no second attempt to put the
wrong end foremost.</p>

<p>Many will cry that such a dinner as I describe is one for
the millionaire and not for the million. They are in error.
In France I have repeatedly partaken of such in families
of very humble means. They are, in fact, economical. At
an ordinary American dinner I have seen seven vegetables
and two meats served at once. Half the number would
have set forth a much better repast, if served in the French
manner. Moreover, an elaborate dinner is not desirable
daily; but to have one, say weekly, is as improving as going
to the opera, or listening to a great poet read his own
verses.</p>

<p>An essential precept of gastronomic culture is to cultivate
a taste for all customary dishes. Every locality has
its own. Snails and mussels and cockscombs are favorite
dishes in Paris, but I have found few Americans enlightened
enough to be willing to like them. A broad taste
adds to one’s own pleasure and that of others. How
disappointing the guest who refuses dish after dish planned
with an eye to his pleasure!</p>

<p>Do not be ashamed of the enjoyments of life which are
derived from judicious eating and drinking. There are no
more accurate standards of a family than its table-manners,
table-service, table-talk. Culture is reflected in them as in
a mirror. Care not if the bigots and Pharisees call you a
wine-bibber and a glutton. You will not be the first to
whom they have applied those epithets, and you need not
<!--141.png--><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 137</span>
be ashamed of your company. In the city of Paris,
where the art of cookery has its home and the Prohibition
party no adherents, dyspepsia is scarcely heard of, and the
arrests for drunkenness during the entire year of 1890 were&mdash;how
many, think you?&mdash;just thirty-eight!</p>

<p>If I have dwelt with some emphasis on the pleasures of
taste, it is because they are little understood in this country
and there is a prevalent tendency to decry them. Those
which are derived from the sense of Hearing will need no
defense. Many of them are matters of constant and
intelligent cultivation. We are said not to be a musical
nation, but certainly both vocal and instrumental artists
are not rare, and those from other countries find among us
their most profitable harvest-fields. The intensity and the
value of the enjoyment derived from music depend on
individual peculiarities which are little modified by cultivation.
Of all the exalted pleasures it is the one least
communicable and least connected with other faculties.
One of the finest pianists in the United States is a negro
idiot, and intellectually an appreciative musical audience
need not be above him. But I have been told that I
have no right to speak about this art. Six generations of
Quaker ancestors, who would not permit an instrument
of music in the house, have nearly extinguished the musical
sense in me.</p>

<p>The music of nature is free to all and intelligible to all.
No instruction is demanded to listen with rapture to the
blithesome carol of the meadow-lark or the cheery notes of
<!--142.png--><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 138</span>
the wood-thrush, joyous denizens of our American fields.
The many voices of the wind, now whispering secrets to the
pines, now whistling impudently outside our windows, now
strident and threatening through the bare branches of
winter, bring us messages suited to all moods, and play
melodies on our hearts as though their strings were stretched
on an Æolian harp. On a sensitive mind the power of
these sounds of the wind is altogether peculiar, and appears
to be owing to the fact that the agency which produces
them is hidden, veiled, and invisible. I would liken it to
the effect of distant church bells, heard through the stillness
of some Sabbath morn, soft, rhythmical, earnest,
inviting us to sweet societies and unseen shrines.</p>

<p>We appreciate too little the delight we almost unconsciously
derive from the sense of hearing through the power
it gives us to have unrestricted social intercourse in conversation,
and to listen to oratory, instruction, and public
entertainments. When we observe how even slight deafness
circumscribes the life and reduces the number of its
sources of enjoyment, we first understand the extent of the
gratifications we owe to the faculty of audition, and how
important to our happiness are its enjoyment and cultivation.</p>

<p>But how vast is the capacity of man for happiness! How
many sources of joy would remain to one deprived of every
sense but that of Sight! All his life would not suffice to
explore the boundless fields of enjoyment which it alone
throws open to him. He has but to cast his eyes around
<!--143.png--><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 139</span>
him to revel in the ever-changing garb of earth, in the
sky with its majestic clouds sailing across the measureless
blue depths, in the splendors of sunrise and sunset, in the
transient glory of the rainbow, and in the immortal light
of the stars. Stretched on the strand, he may mark the
far-off, many-hued, sparkling brine, or elsewhere see great
mountains lift their summits to eternal snow and watch
them bathed in the rosy glamour of the afterglow, seemingly
suspended in mid-air, when night obscures their base.</p>

<p>The beauties of form, line, color, and proportion are
open to him, and the treasures of joy which the noble arts
of painting, sculpture, architecture, drawing, and engraving
have been laboring for thousands of years to enrich the
world with in their fullness belong to him. The delicate
suggestions of light-and-shade and the inexhaustible fertility
of the colorist supply him with storehouses from
which he can fill countless hours of gratification. Those
elements in our nature which respond to the amusing, the
pleasing, the picturesque, and the sublime are almost
equally appealed to through the sense of sight; and were
we to devote ourselves to answering their fascinating
invitations, little leisure should we have left for occupation
with any other sense. Nor among these have I enumerated
those crowning delights to many minds, the faculty of
acquainting themselves with the thoughts of others through
reading, and giving perhaps equal pleasure to others by
writing, both of which are chiefly conditioned on the
sense of sight.</p>

<p><!--144.png--><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 140</span>
What I have written is but an outline, a scatter of unfinished
suggestions, of the numerous enjoyments which we
can obtain by the proper cultivation of our senses. Their
training, and the rational development of all their functions,
are just as essential to our higher life as the cultivation
of those which are sometimes, though falsely, called
our nobler faculties. There is no aristocracy in the kingdom
of nature, and the lowest of our powers, if appropriately
directed and educated, is as worthy to occupy the
throne as any which in popular repute is deemed the
highest.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sensation is the sense of existence.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is no “order of excellence” in the faculties of
man. One is as excellent as another. The only difference
is in the scope of their activities. We should give play
to all according to their strength. This is the profound
lesson of Walt Whitman’s writings.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sensation, Emotion, Intellect, all three, enter into every
action. We should conduct our lives as one plays a game
of three-handed euchre, where the two players who are
behind constantly enter into combinations against the one
who is ahead.</p>

<hr />

<p>Quaff pleasure in sips, not gulps; let it fall like the
<!--145.png--><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 141</span>
manna in the wilderness, a sufficiency daily, not a quantity
at once.</p>

<hr />

<p>Healthy mirth has no reaction. Laughter is lightsome.</p>

<hr />

<p>Good fare, good manners, good company,&mdash;these are the
three graces which should preside over the dinner table.
Then will the meal include, in the words of <a name="chg5" id="chg5"></a>Sydney Smith,
“Everything of sensual and intellectual gratification
which a great nation can glory in producing.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Table-talk,&mdash;the best of talk. Even Kant thought it
not beneath him to give rules for it: first, of the weather
and the roads; next, the current events of the day; then
history, art, and philosophy. So did Marsilius Ficinus:
first, of divine things; then anecdotes; finally, of art and
music.</p>

<hr />

<p>The unthinking are prone to confine the meaning of
Pleasure to Sensation. The coarsest philosophy of life is
the most popular, because it is most easily understood,
and because it appeals to the universal, which are the
merely animal, traits of human nature.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> <span class="title">The Pleasures we may Derive from our
Emotions.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">The emotions are sensations translated into Memory and
commented on by the Imagination, with the usual distortion
and falsification of the original, characteristic of all
translators and commentators.</p>

<p>The primary emotions of Hope and Fear are the recollections
of pleasure or pain projected into the future; the disappointment
of hope or the realization of fear brings sorrow,
regret, or remorse, feelings which are concerned with the
past alone.</p>

<p>These reflections suggest how much our happiness has to
do with Time. If each could estimate for himself the relative
value of the past, the present, and the future, the pursuit
of happiness would be a science with results as certain
as geometry. As it is, most men pass their days, not in
enjoying life, but in getting ready to enjoy it, or in regretting
they did not enjoy it; and those who think they are
wiser, and who boast that they cultivate the present alone,
usually sow it with the seed of thistles and tares to pester
their later lives.</p>

<p>The folly of philosophies&mdash;and, I may add, religions&mdash;has
been their effort to divest man of these natural emotions.</p>

<p><!--147.png--><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 143</span>
“Expect nothing, and you will not be disappointed,”
is the cheerful advice of the pessimist and the Buddhist;
“Fear nothing, for you are in the hands of God,” says the
Christian fatalist. “Regrets are vain,” cries the opportunist;
“live in the present, and let the dead past bury
its dead.”</p>

<p>In practical affairs, the best philosophy is common sense,
which is nothing else than the abstract and epitome of the
experience of all mankind through all time; and this arbiter
condemns all three of the above maxims as the words of
folly and not of wisdom. Hope, fear, and regret are equally
necessary to the safe conduct of life with a view to securing
the greatest enjoyment from it, and the only point left to
consider is the relative extent in which each should be indulged.
About this I shall offer a few suggestions.</p>

<p>The skillful architect of his own career will not draw a
plan which is either too broad or too high for his means to
construct. His hopes will be neither too exalted nor too
extended. To be as happy as possible, we must never
expect to be extremely happy. Complete happiness is an
ideal condition, and we are never farther from the ideal
than when we think we have it in our grasp. Nor will his
plans be elaborate. The larger the foundation, the more
time and money it takes to build the house. The chief
enjoyment in life should be drawn from a few, easily accessible
sources; though this should not lead us to neglect
others that come in our way. One should not refuse a
bequest because he has a profitable business. Few understand
<!--148.png--><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 144</span>
the limits of their own capacity for happiness. They
do not know, as the saying is, when they are well off, and,
like a restless inventor, spoil the machine by constantly
seeking to improve it. They should ponder on an epitaph
on a tombstone in a London churchyard:&mdash;“I was well;
I would be better; I am here.”</p>

<p>Our hopes should not belong to the class called by
physicians “incompatibles;” that is, when the realization
of one will certainly or probably prevent that of the other.
Few errors are more common than this, and few are productive
of greater disappointment. Reasonable reflection
and ordinary self-knowledge will generally suffice to
prevent it. If I set out in life to make a million dollars I
cannot expect also to become a distinguished Sanscrit
scholar.</p>

<p>The fruition of our hopes should not be placed in a distant
future. Life is uncertain, but that is the least objection.
What is certain is, that we ourselves shall not be the
same next year or next week that we are to-day. Our
tastes and moods will change, and it is quite likely that we
shall care nothing for the fruit of the plants we are now so
diligently cultivating.</p>

<p>This consideration leads up to the last and probably the
most useful of all the suggestions on this subject which I
shall offer, that is, that in planning for the future, it will,
as a rule, repay us best to devote our most earnest and constant
attention to the avoidance of pain or misfortune
rather than to the preparation of projects of pleasure.
<!--149.png--><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 145</span>
We know what we are about when we set to work to forestall
a danger or to prevent a disaster; we are by no means
so sure as to what course of action will yield us pleasure.
The best laid schemes “gang aft a-gley.”</p>

<p>Hope and Fear are both deceivers; but we like the company
of Hope even when we know she lies; and dislike
that of Fear the more, the closer we believe she tells the
truth. Many temperaments are tortured more by the dread
of misfortune than by misfortune, and are constantly sacrificing
the happiness of the present for fear they may not
enjoy the future. To such as these would apply the pregnant
maxim of Lord Bacon,&mdash;“The only thing to be feared
is fear.”</p>

<p>When in reason and in due proportion to its object, the
emotion is salutary and protective. To know what to fear,
to take precautions and thus to avoid dangers, are the very
conditions of existence. Cowardice is contemptible, but
foolhardiness is senseless.</p>

<p>In modern life the most common forms of fear are worry
and anxiety. To a certain extent these also are wholesome;
there may be good ground for them, and so long as they
act as stimulants to healthful activity, they are not to be
shirked; but when they lead to morbid states of mind and
body, they should be met with appropriate remedies.</p>

<p>The first of these is a deliberate and calm study of the
situation and the real causes for fear, if there are any.
Spectres lose their terrors by daylight, and most fears are
vastly diminished by reflection. What if the worst does
<!--150.png--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 146</span>
come? The worst is never as bad as we imagine it will be.
We may also call to mind how useless are many of our anxieties.
Why worry about disasters which we cannot prevent?
Still less should we worry about those which we can
prevent.</p>

<p>When reason and thought will not dispel our fears, we
must fight the devil with fire, and conquer one emotion
with another. The opponent of Fear is not so much Hope
as Courage. Courage recognizes the danger and meets it
with a serene front. Confidence in one’s powers, the
thought of the prize to be won, the love of glory and
reputation, a knowledge of the means at our disposal, and
a faith in fortune are the considerations which strengthen
courage, and if they are marshaled in battle array and led
by Enthusiasm, the fears which hovered over our path will
be routed like flocks of evil-boding birds.</p>

<p>An easier though less noble escape from fear is Apathy.
In different forms it appears as resignation to the will of
God, or the inevitable, indifference to results, and philosophic
or religious fatalism. An Arab proverb says there
are two days on which it is needless to fear death,&mdash;the
day on which it is decreed we shall not die, and the day
on which it is decreed we shall die; and if death need not
be feared, what else should be? Modern science is inclined
to the doctrine that men’s doings are ruled by absolute
necessity, and that free will is a delusion. For one, I do
not accept the doctrine; but he that does should be
released from fear if his logic has any validity.</p>

<p><!--151.png--><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 147</span>
As the future is clouded with fear and its congeners, so
the past is embittered with regret, if not with its gloomier
fellows, the pains of contrition and the agonies of remorse.
Of all mental misery I have ever witnessed, that of remorse
for irreparable injuries done to others was by far the
acutest. No one who intimately sees such a spectacle but
will learn a lesson which will be a warning for a lifetime.
Suicide or insanity is its usual result. But for the lighter
forms of regret, reflection on their uselessness, willingness
to make reparation, intelligent study of the mistakes of the
past as lessons for the future, are remedies which we can
always apply with benefit. The keen regret which we feel
at our own blunders and shortcomings produces almost a
distaste for life. But we may recall the homely business
proverb, that he who never makes mistakes never makes
anything; and it is something of a satisfaction to think that
we did not display the full measure of our capacities in a
transaction, but could do it much better had we to do it
over again.</p>

<p>The emotions which I have been considering are passive
in their nature, and their presence does not markedly
influence our external lives. This is not the case with the
emotion of Anger, the manifestations of which are primarily
external. This is why it is so extremely detrimental
to family and social happiness. A person who is choleric,
of a bad temper, or an irritable disposition, is heavily
handicapped for both the pursuit of happiness and the race
<!--152.png--><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 148</span>
for success. I think I have seen more fine prospects ruined
by this than by any other single trait; and on the ruins
promptly sprang up the weeds of dejection, misanthropy,
and moroseness. No other weakness so frequently poisons
the joys of married life as a “tempery” disposition. Its
control is always difficult, never impossible. The simple
precept is, to remain entirely silent and motionless for at
least a minute after every flash of anger or sense of irritability.
Lord Herbert of Cherbury tells of a splenetic
friend of his, whose face would flush almost purple at such
moments, but who never broke his self-imposed silence,
and therefore never spoke a word which he had to regret.
A determined intention to control oneself, and steady
practice, will always give such self-mastery.</p>

<p>Anger, when it passes into the chronic form of Hatred,
seeks its satisfaction in Revenge. It is rather surprising to
find such a calm author as Professor Bain including revenge
among the essentials of happiness. In moments of anger
the thirst for vengeance is keen, and its gratification pleasant
for the time; but from my own experience and that of
others whom I have asked, the vengeance which finally
appeases long hatred falls far short of affording the gratification
we expected, and is even associated with some
dissatisfaction with self. The game has not been worth
the candle. The satisfaction is greater when our enemy
brings ruin on himself through the traits and acts we abhor
in him. We can then indulge in an unselfish joy in the
<!--153.png--><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 149</span>
spectacle, as did the Israelites when the pride of the
Pharaohs was humbled by the consequences of their own
arrogance and stiff-neckedness.</p>

<p>The Imagination belongs to the emotional rather than
the intellectual faculties, as it has small regard for truth
and casts on all things the glamour of that light “which
never was on sea or land.” Its judicious cultivation adds
to the higher enjoyments of life by lifting the events and
thoughts of our daily rounds into the mystic realm of the
ideal. It is cultivated by the perusal of works of poetry
and fiction, and by yielding to the sweet influences of
music, song, and the arts of pleasure. In the young it
generally needs to be, not so much curbed, as directed in
the right road, and in the old to be stimulated. The
neglect of it so common in middle life is an unwise preparation
for those years which at the best can expect but
scant pleasure in watching the mirage of ideal anticipation.</p>

<p>Under the Esthetic Emotions we may class all those which
arise from the occupation with what is interesting or beautiful
in nature or art. They are perennial fonts of enjoyment
to those who will cultivate them in the right spirit&mdash;which
is, to study them exclusively for the pleasure they
yield, and without ulterior aim of utility or didactic purpose.
True art acknowledges no allegiance either to utilitarianism
or morality&mdash;though it is never useless or immoral.
Its right aim is to excite within us the consciousness
of ourselves by stirring our imagination and feelings
<!--154.png--><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 150</span>
into agreeable activity. The emotions which it inspires in
the individual rise in value in proportion as they are
communicable to others, and thereby develop their contrast
to the pleasures of the senses, which are and always
remain personal. On the other hand, they differ from
those of the intellect by their aim being directed to
exciting the faculties which are human. Their limits are
defined by these, while the intellect soars far beyond. In
the esthetic arts, Man is everything; all refers to him; in
science he is nothing, or, at most, a drop in the shoreless
ocean of the Universe.</p>

<p>What justice can I render within the limit of a few
sentences to the pleasurable emotions excited by the contemplation
of Nature? Volumes have been written about
and have not exhausted the catalogue of joys offered by the
solitary walk through forest and mead, surrounded by that
mysterious world in blade and leaf, in bird and insect, in
brook and bower, so tantalizingly open and yet so impenetrably
closed to our vision. We need no laborious learning,
and require no Alps, or ocean, or mighty cataracts, to
surcharge our souls with that strange calm and silent joy
which Mother Nature ever has ready to pour into the
wounds of her returned and wounded sons. A stroll at
sunset, through the cow-pasture, by the stream, is all we
need, if only our minds are open to the voices and the
pictures spread before us. Need I mention the pleasures
of gardening, or the charms of the training and companionship
of those humbler animals, our pets and favorites, to
<!--155.png--><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 151</span>
whose sincerity and affection we so often turn with relief
from association with our own species?</p>

<p>Nor shall I go at any length into the obvious pleasure
afforded by even a slight acquaintance with painting,
sculpture, architecture, photographic reproductions, engraving,
those avocations distinctively called by some
writers the “arts of pleasure.” The very purpose of
their creation was to increase the happiness of life, and
those who are content to live without understanding and
to some extent appreciating what they contribute to human
enjoyment, may as well lay down this book at this point,
for its whole purpose is alien to them. In some quarters
there is a prejudice against these arts; in many more a suspicion
that they are frivolous or enervating. Far from it.
Goethe, who beyond any other man of this century studied
the strengthening of his faculties, recommended that each
day we should for at least a few minutes give our minds to
the contemplation of some fine work of art or beautiful
natural object, were it but a careful engraving, the reproduction
of some masterpiece, a pot of natural flowers, or a
sunset from our windows. He had found this in his own
experience both strengthening and comforting, and none
is so indigent or so occupied that it is beyond his reach.</p>

<p>In museums and picture galleries, in the theatre and the
opera, in illustrated books and collections of photographs,
we have abundant resources to gratify our desire for observing
art; and if we wish to share the delights of practicing
it, there are the numerous “minor arts,” admirably set
<!--156.png--><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 152</span>
forth for self-instruction in excellent manuals,&mdash;free-hand
drawing, water-colors, china painting, embroidery&mdash;who
can remember all of them?</p>

<p>The finest fruit of the culture of the esthetic emotions,
culled from their sunniest sides and served as “human
nature’s daily food,” is what we call “good taste.” What
an admirable faculty! It is the best of good sense, and
walks hand in hand with good manners and good morals.
It prunes away exaggerations and affectations, it erases
superlatives, it modifies antipathies, and lessens prejudices.
The modest home lighted by its fairy lamp shines with a
radiance that the luxury of the vulgar plutocrat can never
approach. The damsel whose simple garb has been hung
by its unfaltering hands will please, when the elaborate
toilettes of fashion leave the heart untouched. How much
to be envied is the natural possessor of this charming
quality! More profitable than envying would be the
effort to cultivate it, through the study of the rules of art,
the observations of the best models of harmony, and the
willingness to accept the opinions of others on subjects
where they are acknowledged authorities and to search the
reasons on which they are grounded.</p>

<p>The pleasure which we derive from the emotion which
is called “Plot-interest” is peculiar and popular. We
see it in the avidity with which we follow the adventures
of imaginary characters in a novel or drama. It
evokes the liveliest sympathy and excitement. Tears follow
laughter in quick succession, and with as little real cause.
<!--157.png--><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 153</span>
We yield ourselves willingly to the situation, and in the
fancied sorrows of the heroine forget our own, which are
real.</p>

<p>Akin to those of plot-interest are the Emotions of
Pursuit, which impart such zest to hunting, fishing, and
allied sports. We care little for the quarry; a “paper
chase” is almost as exciting as a lion hunt; but it is the
sense of the self-conscious and strenuous exertion of our
faculties which gives us the enjoyment. This explanation
may not be obvious in the case of the enthusiastic angler,
who sits by a dull canal under an umbrella all the afternoon,
satisfied with a few gudgeons; but this enthusiasm makes
up for the lack of positive exertion.</p>

<p>More obscure is the intense and absorbing pleasure which
most derive from the Emotions of Risk, which are excited
by games, especially those of chance, or where skill is so
equally balanced that chance comes in for a large share of
the result. This is pre-eminently the emotion which most
men cultivate in their hours of recreation. Billiards,
chess, pool, cards, backgammon, horse-racing, athletic
games, and personal contests, where the opponents are as
equally matched as practicable, make up to most minds
the definition of Enjoyment. The various games of cards
offer the most favorable types of games, as when played
fairly and well they have a large and constant element of
chance. They have been in ill odor, as being the most
convenient means for gambling. But to the one who really
enjoys the emotions of risk, the stakes are subordinate.
<!--158.png--><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 154</span>
Any one who appreciates the charms of a rubber of whist,
or the agreeable exercise of a game of billiards, will not
want the additional and often unpleasant addition of a
stake, and those who fail to appreciate, or neglect to cultivate,
these emotions as a source of pleasure in life, deprive
themselves of that which would cheer many a sad hour by
innocent and healthful employment.</p>

<p>When I glance back at what I have written, I see I
have done little more than catalogue, and that incompletely,
the sources of enjoyment offered by the Emotions.
But if this superficial survey developed such possibilities,
how much of the pure gold of joy awaits the careful prospector
who will follow the veins and sift the sands of the
region thus thrown open to his energies?</p>

<hr />

<p>There is this peculiarity in both works of art and scenes
of natural beauty, that they impress us most vividly in
periods of deepest dejection or highest elation, and are thus
incomparable aids in restoring mental equilibrium.</p>

<hr />

<p>The painful, the hideous, and the shocking are legitimate
inspirations of art, as well as the beautiful and agreeable.
The latter intimate the direction we should go, the
former the dangers we may have to encounter and the
existence of suffering which calls for our sympathy.</p>

<p><!--159.png--><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 155</span></p>
<hr />

<p>Fear and Folly are the couple whose offspring is Distress.</p>

<hr />

<p>The emotion that does not incite to action, enfeebles.</p>

<hr />

<p>Activity does not mean excitement. Healthful action
is uniform. The wheel of most rapid revolution is the
most regular in its motion.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nature soothes because she knows nothing of our conflicts.
Like Spinoza’s God, she loves no one and hates no
one.</p>

<hr />

<p>Not nature, but nature’s infinite analogies, are what
quicken the heart and supply it with endless interpretations
of its own experiences.</p>

<hr />

<p>The sombre, the desolate, and the vast in nature appeal
most strongly to the educated spirit, because they typify
what is measureless, and therefore mournful, in its aspirations.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> <span class="title">The Pleasures we may Derive from
the Intellect.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">When I speak about billiards and fishing and opera-going
as pleasures, I am sure everybody understands me.
But now that I have to refer to the enjoyment derived from
study and thinking and scientific research, I fear the
majority will prepare to stifle their yawns or skip the
chapter.</p>

<p>Yet I have heard of, and even known, men who turned
to such occupations for their highest felicity, and counted
such joys above gold or lust or glory or love,&mdash;because
enemies might rob them of these, but never of the treasures
of the understanding. The one aim of their lives
was the Search for Truth; and to them all truths seemed
equally great, equally worthy devotion. One spent years
in the study of polyps and fungi, and by them learned to
explain the laws which have developed man and mind;
another neglected his profession in order to investigate the
anatomy of a worm, and made a discovery which restored
thousands of his fellow-beings from wretched invalidism to
happy health.</p>

<p>Such exceptional beings are not to be set up as the pole
stars for all mariners over life’s ocean. A man cannot be
<!--161.png--><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 157</span>
happy beyond the tastes and faculties which he has; and
it is as absurd to expect all to enjoy equally the pleasures
of the intellect as it would be to look for all to be pleased
with the flavor of the same dish. Every man, however,
who is not idiotic or insane possesses an intellect, and can
derive a great deal of pleasure from its cultivation; and it
is always to some degree in his power to cultivate it in the
right manner.</p>

<p>If he only knew the many advantages of these pleasures
he would not fail to give them his attention. Almost alone
of enjoyments they leave behind them no sense of exhaustion,
no painful reaction or regrets. They are as varied as
our moods, suited as well to assuage our sadness as to prolong
our cheerful moments. At no period of the year are
they out of season, age does not wither them, nor does
“custom stale their infinite variety.” They are social or
solitary as we choose to make them, and they know no
sense of satiety, as with them the appetite grows by what it
feeds on. They flatter our self-complacency by showing
us that we are growing wiser, and they stir within us sympathy
and appreciation for others. They are always at
hand, for the appreciative student carries between the
covers of his Shakespeare more pleasure than the millionaire
can stow in his yacht. Finally, and as the clinching
argument in their favor, they are economical, doubly
economical, for they cost little or nothing, and they save
us many a broad piece which we should have had to spend
for pleasures gratifying the senses the same length of time;
<!--162.png--><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 158</span>
economical also of our lives, for the student class are those
who have the greatest longevity.</p>

<p>Especially would I urge women to pursue intellectual
pleasures rather than those of the emotions, to which they
are now largely confined. Some of the most promising
marriages fail through lack of intellectual sympathy in the
wife. How sad it is to read these words of John Stuart
Mill in his essay on the liberty of women,&mdash;“Young men
of the greatest promise generally cease to improve as soon
as they marry;” a result which he attributes directly to the
absence of sympathy in their wives for that which constitutes
the highest culture, and often a direct opposition to
it. His opinion is valid everywhere, though it should be
true nowhere. For the sake of her husband and her children,
she should resolutely turn to the cultivation of her
mind as one of the firmest holds on their affections.</p>

<p>One of the simplest forms of intellectual pleasure is that
which is derived from riddles, puzzles, conundrums, and
rebuses. Children and primitive nations are especially
captivated by these agreeable stimulants to their ingenuity.
In French country towns they are highly popular, and
many of the cafés have <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cercles</i> who meet nightly to solve
the enigmas proposed in the weekly papers and forward
the solutions to the editor. Those which are successful
receive a small prize or an honorable mention. The
placid bourgeois appear to derive extraordinary enjoyment
from this pastime.</p>

<p>Most people understand “cultivating the intellect” to
<!--163.png--><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 159</span>
mean reading. Sometimes it has this result, but generally
it is too desultory, miscellaneous, and aimless. Were it
directed to a more definite purpose it could be made to
yield more profit and more enjoyment. I do not mean
to the purpose of instruction, as probably the reader has
been in haste to suppose, but so as to endow the mind
with a wider range of interests and thus with more sources
of pleasure.</p>

<p>Read what interests you and interest yourself in what
you read&mdash;that is the best rule. I have a small opinion of
lists of the “hundred best books,” or courses of reading
cut and dried for you by large societies. They may instruct,
as do lessons appointed by a master; but I am
speaking of reading for pleasure; and really that is the
only kind worth mentioning. I have always liked reading,
but I never could bear to lay out a course for myself, still
less follow any proposed by another.</p>

<p>My own very satisfactory plan has been like that of
the prospector for minerals. He wanders aimlessly over the
mountains till he finds the sign of ore; then he ceases his
roving and traces out the vein with zeal and patience.
You read an article in a magazine; on one point mentioned
you would like further information. Do not pass it by and
forget it, but go to the encyclopedia or the library and
follow it up; it will lead you to two or three volumes, not
to be read, but to be consulted; these will start several
allied points of interest; look them up in the same manner;
<!--164.png--><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 160</span>
and before you know it you will be burrowing for hours
among books with the greatest delight.</p>

<p>By adopting this plan you not only pursue the bent of
your own inclination and follow your own fancies, but
without knowing it you are obeying some of the most
scholastic rules for reading laid down by the learned.</p>

<p>One of these is to “distribute the attention;” by
which they mean to learn to pass easily from one subject to
another. Do not become so absorbed in one line that
others have no charm for you. This is a common error
with students of specialties. The great Darwin regretted
that toward the close of his life his unremitted attention to
science had destroyed his power of appreciating poetry and
the drama. Yet neither should one hurry from book to
book, or from topic to topic. Each should be pursued up
to the point of commencing fatigue; then the volume
should be laid down, and an effort made to recall the main
facts we have read, and arrange them in order in the mind.
What looks like desultory reading will not remain desultory
long if pursued in accordance with these suggestions.</p>

<p>As to what kind of books to read, the brief answer is,
all kinds. Variety is the guiding principle. Do not read
in ruts. Some say we should always have some main theme
to which others should be subordinate. The advice is
good for those who have by nature some such leading interest;
only for them it is unnecessary; and for those who
have not, I believe it is useless, for such an interest can
<!--165.png--><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 161</span>
rarely be created by the will. I doubt if one can say off-hand,&mdash;“From
this out, my chief interest shall be in the
history of Ancient Egypt,” or something of that kind.
Disraeli once remarked that biography has a greater interest
than history, because it is life without theory; and
French writers are better than English, because they have
fewer ridiculous ideas of life. Some such plea could be
entered for every department of literature, and each would
be just. Unquestionably, the tendency at present is to read
too exclusively works of the imagination, novels, romances,
dramas, and the like; the pleasure they yield is ephemeral
and is apt to disqualify for that which is more persistent
though less intense, derived from works based on objective
realities.</p>

<p>For one branch of literature I must, however, put in a
special claim, as it has been such a pleasure to me ever
since I learned to read, and that is Poetry. I have heard
it sometimes said that this is a taste of youth, and dies a
natural death with advancing years. My own experience
is quite the contrary. The delight we derive from accurate
rhythm, melodious words, fine thoughts, and the depicting
of deep emotions, ought to increase as our experience of the
world and wider learning make us more familiar with them.
This has been the result in my own case and in that of
others whom I know or have heard of; for instance, Sir
Henry Holland, writing his biography when about eighty
years of age, lays stress on the enjoyment the study of the
poets continued to afford him; and my mother, at eighty,
<!--166.png--><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 162</span>
derived much pleasure in committing to memory and repeating
new poems. There is a sense of completeness, of
perfection, which is given a fine thought by appropriate
expression in rhythmical language, which prose can never
equal, and which, through the potent magic of Form, lifts
the mind out of the material into the ideal world, and
grants us a momentary glimpse of the Infinite.</p>

<p>If we do not recall to mind and think over what we read
we lose most of the pleasure and all the profit of the action.
This was what the English philosopher Hobbes meant when
he said,&mdash;“If I had read as many books as some men, I
should be as ignorant as they.” To read without reflecting
is like buying grain for food and never grinding it.
Through reflection on the images, incidents, and forms of
expression with which reading has stored the memory, the
highest enjoyment from the process is secured. The mind,
like the body, is maintained in a state of pleasurable
activity, not by what it swallows, but by what it digests
and assimilates. Many people, however, are like dear
Charles Lamb, who artlessly confessed,&mdash;“I cannot sit
and think&mdash;books think for me;” and if they think for
all to such good purpose as they did for him, no one
could complain.</p>

<p>In fact, reflection, meditation, though its pleasures have
been chanted by poets and sages for thousands of years, is
probably that form of intellectual activity which is least
admired and least desired of any. It is not the same as
“studying out a subject,” or exerting the creative faculty,
<!--167.png--><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 163</span>
as an inventor when he is devising a machine; but the
leisurely calling up from our memory of its various contents.
They may be from reading or from conversation or from
our experience of life. We may present these to ourselves
as the pictures of a gallery or as the scenes of a drama or
as a series of connected events; and we may endeavor to
discern what relations they bore to each other, or speculate
on what would have been the results had they occurred
differently, or not at all. We may renew half-forgotten
pleasures, or smile at useless pains, or recall long since
vanished woes. Lessons for our guidance or knowledge
of ourselves may unexpectedly come to us as the results
of such self-communing; or we may cast our eyes to the
future, and enjoy in prolonged anticipation those pleasures
which may never come, or, if they come, can last but a
moment. This is the nature of that reflection which, if
we learn it and cultivate it, will enable us to pass many a
pleasant hour, when otherwise we should be cut off from all
sources of amusement, as in some dreary waiting for a
train or enforced and lonely vigil.</p>

<p>As solitude is thus relieved by exercise of our minds,
society by the same may have many an added charm.
What a fund of rational enjoyment is offered by reading
circles, debating societies, literary coteries, and associations
for the purpose of studying Shakespeare or Browning or
Ibsen, or whatever other literary star may be in the ascendant!
There are some pretentious persons who profess to
be above such gatherings. They can well be dispensed
<!--168.png--><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 164</span>
with in them. The tendency to be guarded against in
order to make such schemes prosperous is that of improving
the mind. This should be entirely incidental and
secondary. When one joins a dining club, he expects a
dinner which he likes, not a special diet prescribed by his
medical adviser; and so it should be with literary clubs.
Let the improvement take care of itself. It will do so.</p>

<p>Alongside of reading and reflection we must place
writing. Many will need no explanation why this should
be classed among the pleasures of life; while to others it
is always a distasteful drudgery. They escape it whenever
possible, and reduce it to its lowest terms, which means
letter-writing&mdash;and in their case always the writing of
very middling letters. A letter, indeed, is a great tell-tale,
and tells the more the less it says. A score of years in
editorial work, during which the competency of numerous
writers had to be gauged by some quick standard, taught
me that the letter of transmittal is generally enough to
decide on the merits of the manuscript offered. To him
who can appreciate its revelations there is no more
infallible test of general culture than an ordinary letter.</p>

<p>Correspondence by some is classed among the lost arts.
As an art, we can let it go; but as one of the most agreeable
of pleasures, it will ever remain. Nature, not art, is
what gives it its charm. The free expressions of personal
feelings, thoughts, and observations, the intimacy and confidence
which we can never find in books or magazines, the
household words and pet phrases which grow up between
<!--169.png--><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 165</span>
correspondents, the tacit assumptions of common tastes
and knowledge, these are what endow correspondence
with its boundless charms for those who cultivate it.</p>

<p>Some writers have extolled the pleasure to be derived
from keeping a diary. They claim it gives one much
delight to turn back to an accurate record of what he did
or heard or saw at a given period of his past life. They
add that it is also a judicious habit for our own well-being,
teaching us what errors we have made, what false opinions
harbored, what aims pursued fruitlessly, and the like. I
believe what these writers say, and commend their advice
to those for whom it is suited. As for myself, I never
could follow it. The diaries which I have occasionally
begun, I have usually ended by throwing into the fire. It
seems to me a man must either progress very little, be
supernaturally wise to begin with, or have incredible self-complacency,
to read with satisfaction a diary of his own
five years old which contains anything but the most naked
facts. Amiel’s diary is one of the most attractive published
of recent years; but it certainly could have been no
pleasure to his sensitive mind to have renewed its sorrows
by perusing its morbid reflections.</p>

<p>I have left to the last the consideration of the highest of
all intellectual joys,&mdash;the Pursuit of Truth. This should be
the aim of every thought, and the sole, conscious occupation
of our understandings. As our senses are satisfied
only with pleasure, in like manner our reason finds no rest
until it attains to what is true. That man is useless on the
<!--170.png--><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 166</span>
face of the earth, and wastes his life, who devotes his time
to anything else than the pursuit of happiness or the search
for truth.</p>

<p>They are not antagonistic. They are compatible one
with the other; perhaps they are identical, when both are
clearly seen and correctly understood. That great teacher
who rejected the narrow prescriptions of asceticism, and
came eating meat and drinking wine, also taught that the
one comforter, the Paraclete, which should in future ages
complete the happiness of man, is “the Spirit of Truth.”</p>

<p>There need be no discussion as to what Truth is, nor
need we, like jesting Pilate, make the inquiry and “stop
not to hear reply.” The answer is as clear as it is brief.
Truth is that which will bear constant and free examination.
Renewed observation, verification, re-examination, investigation&mdash;whatever
is true will bear all these without diminution
of its lustre; and any statement which men advance
as true, but are unwilling to submit to these tests, they
know is more or less of a lie.</p>

<p>The highest and clearest truths are to be found in the
physical and natural sciences. The latter especially offer
unending pleasant vistas to those who can interest themselves
in them. The passion of collecting in natural
history is a rich source of enjoyment, inexpensive, always
open, exhaustless in extent. Whether it be minerals, plants,
insects, coins, weapons, or what not, their accumulation
occupies vacant hours and they furnish abundant materials
for thought, reading, study, and conversation. The man
<!--171.png--><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 167</span>
who has a cabinet stocked by his own efforts is one who
never complains of ennui. The day for him is never too
long.</p>

<p>As for the devotees of Science, there is no need for me
to inform them of the pleasure they derive from its pursuit.
They are too well acquainted with its joys, transcending
any which wealth or popular renown can offer, to care to
read their eulogy. But this intense devotion must be born
with one or date from some early association, and can
rarely be acquired in mature years, so that it need not be
dwelt upon here.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Life according to reason,”&mdash;this was Aristotle’s definition
of happiness.</p>

<hr />

<p>The intellect is cold because it is unsympathetic. We
must cultivate with it the imagination, which by vividly
portraying pain, develops sympathy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Do you wish to improve your mind? Then read carefully
what you do not understand, and listen dispassionately to
what you do not agree with.</p>

<hr />

<p>Error is more agreeable than truth, because the latter
points out our limitations and the former conceals them.</p>

<p><!--172.png--><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 168</span></p>
<hr />

<p>An error actively advocated is healthier than a truth
lazily accepted. Thought becomes fecund only in action.</p>

<hr />

<p>A mistake is sooner corrected than a falsehood, because
it is nobody’s interest to maintain it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Novel-reading is the fashionable narcotic; opium, chloral,
and hasheesh together count fewer victims.</p>

<hr />

<p>All that is, is a prophecy of what will be; hence, to a
philosopher, the chief interest in things is their symbolical
value.</p>

<hr />

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vivre caché, c’est vivre heureux.</i> This was Descartes’
motto. It should be translated: “To be able to retire
with pleasure to your own thoughts, is to be happy.”</p>

<hr />

<p>What is the pleasure of being famous? That of being
talked of by those you do not know, who do not know
you, and in whom you take no interest.</p>

<p class="p2">After all, the only standard of value which we need apply
to anything is the amount and quality of Happiness it yields.
This alone can concern Man anywhere and at any time.
His religions should be measured by no other mete-yard.
All were created by man, for the happiness of man;
though all claim another, a superhuman, origin, and pretend
to bear the sign-manual of the Divine.</p>

<p>They are right, and what seems a paradox is a sober fact.
As much the productions of human hands and brains as
are the robes and paintings in which they are bedecked,
they have something in them which no externals can represent,
and which lifts them above their material drapery.
Human beyond all else that man has devised, for that very
reason they are superhuman.</p>

<p>The strange law of Evolution is, that nothing in nature
reaches its perfection but by becoming something else.
The species in attaining its utmost development is transformed
into another species. Man would not be the
noblest product of the earth did he not feel himself too
noble for it; did not the presage and aura of a higher
destiny forever float around his thoughts, making themselves
<!--174.png--><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 170</span>
felt at the moments of the utmost tension of his
faculties; as when behind the parapet of Chillon one rises
on extreme tip-toe, and catches a glimpse of the glittering
lake and massive Alps beyond.</p>

<p>The vital principle, the motive power, which has created
and maintained all religions is the Ideal of Humanity.
Each age has had its own, each individual has his own, no
two the same. Creeds and churches do but formulate and
endeavor to materialize the average conceptions of a period
or a class; but their labor is vain. Rejecting the old,
putting on the new, the race marches forward to loftier
ideals, the milestones of its progress being the wrecks of
temples and the ruins of churches. Religions rise and fall
and disappear; but Religion grows forever, because it is the
inseparable associate, aye, the very expression, of that
mysterious impulse on which man’s future development
depends, and which makes him part and parcel of the
infinite Energy in which he lives and moves and has his
being.</p>

<p>Time and Truth will reconcile all religions; but the
time will be long and the truth will be slow to make its
way. The schools of dogmatic doctrine claim to have
embalmed in a creed and confined in a code the whole
truth necessary for the happiness of man; not perceiving
that they are like children to whom a magician hands a box
in which he seems to have shut a pigeon; they open it cautiously,
to discover that it is empty, and he points to the
bird soaring up to the sky. Only they take good care not to
<!--175.png--><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 171</span>
open the box. Their schools and teachers resemble those
feeble-minded folk who imagine they increase in knowledge
by constantly talking to themselves.</p>

<p>Always boasting of their devotion to truth, they steadily
repudiate it. That alone is true which will bear repeated,
free, and unbiased investigation; but dogmatists cry,&mdash;“Never
discuss your faith; never doubt your creed; for
he that doubteth is damned.” What progress they make is
not from within, but is forced on them from without by
the free spirit of inquiry; and what they thus unwillingly
accept, they audaciously claim as the product of their own
efforts. Everywhere the spirit of ecclesiasticism is the
secret or open foe of strict and complete veracity; and
yet no permanent alleviation of the sufferings of mankind
can come except from veracity. And from this it will
come. No matter what the weather is, this seed is sure to
grow.</p>

<p>What unspeakable unhappiness religions have brought
on the race! Altars dripping with the blood of human
victims, mothers casting their babes into the fires of
Moloch, teachers crucified by the rabble whom they sought
to instruct, millions perishing between the Crescent and
the Cross, hideous chambers of the Inquisition, Bruno
burning alive in Catholic Rome, and Legate in Protestant
London,&mdash;a thousand such historic events would give no
notion of the miseries which religions have inflicted on
mankind, and continue to inflict.</p>

<p>Worse than these have been their blighting breath on
<!--176.png--><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 172</span>
individual minds, darkening them with terrors of the
supernatural, with racking doubts, despair, and madness;
destroying the natural and beautiful growths of the affections;
frowning on the attractions of the arts of beauty;
crushing the desire of knowledge and the love of investigation;
urging men in the ignoble egotism of self-salvation
to sacrifice their own happiness and that of those nearest
and dearest to them. These influences still exist; they are
ever in the spirit of clericalism and dogmatism, and are
restrained from plunging mankind again into the dark
ages only by that higher and real religion which acknowledges
neither form nor creed nor dogma, but only the
might and right of Truth and Love.</p>

<p>I would ask what teachings do religions&mdash;and I have
those in mind which are prevalent in civilized countries
to-day&mdash;impart, which in any way compensate for the
enormous unhappiness and intellectual degradation thus
caused?</p>

<p>Most sects calling themselves Christian will at once reply
that the happiness they promise is not of this world but of
the next, and that he who looks for enjoyment here will
forfeit it hereafter. Yet when the evidence for this daring
statement is asked for, not an iota can be offered on
which there is unanimous concurrence among the sects
themselves.</p>

<p>What they do offer, and what gives them their real control
over men’s minds, may be summed up as follows: A
belief in the Divine government of the world and the
<!--177.png--><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 173</span>
paternal care of God over each believer in Him; greater
cheerfulness in the acceptance of the misfortunes of life
as the wise and ultimately beneficent decisions of His will;
an expectation of a life after death; the hope that sins will
be forgiven; and the improvement in morals which follows
these convictions.</p>

<p>These are undoubtedly valuable aids to human happiness.
The question is, what part of them belong to Religion and
what to religions; in other words, will not the religious
sentiment itself, freed from the shackles of dogmatic belief,
yield to man all the happiness offered by sectarian doctrines,
relieved of the misery to which they condemn him?
When I think of the mental agony caused in millions of
lives by the pictures of hell, of eternal damnation, of the
last judgment, and of a cruel and merciless God, which
most Christian teachers hold before their congregations, I
long for the time predicted by that apostle of the new life,
Giordano Bruno,&mdash;“When the gods shall lie in Orcus, and
the dread of everlasting punishment shall vanish from the
world.”</p>

<p>Reason has no conflict with religion. Science is based
on the assumption that the order of the Universe is one of
intelligence, and of an intelligence identical with ours.
All force is directed by reasoning energy, which means
that it is purposive. Why seek further? Call it Energy or
Force or God, the thought is the same.</p>

<p>Whether that share which we possess in the energy of
the All remains in personality after physical death, what
<!--178.png--><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 174</span>
dogma can prove? what science deny? Enough that in
the beautiful words of the burial service of the Protestant
Episcopal Church, we are justified in retaining “a reasonable
and holy hope” that the victory of the grave is not
eternal. Should it be so, what is the dread of it but a
delusion of the imagination, which pictures non-existence
as felt in non-existence?</p>

<p>The sense of sin, the story of the fall and its expiation
by a divine sacrifice; is it not strange that no one word
that this was His mission escaped the lips of Him who is
said to have been the willing victim? The notion of sin
as taught in dogmatic belief has no existence in the
unwarped mind nor in scientific psychology. Men are
involved in a chain of cause and effect from which they
have little chance of escape; and even human justice revolts
at administering punishment for involuntary acts. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout
comprendre, c’est tout pardonner</i>; that infinite Mind, which
sees before and after, asks the blood of no victim to understand
and to pardon the blind gropings of the wretched
children of men.</p>

<p>What abuse has been made of the doctrine of Faith! Its
upas-shade has harbored the grossest growths of superstition.
Faith is either laziness or cowardice. We accept the
opinions of others to save ourselves the trouble of forming
our own, or to escape the pains of doubt. But doubt
is painful only to him who accepts on authority, not to him
who honestly seeks, truth through the efforts of his own
powers.</p>

<p><!--179.png--><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 175</span>
But piety, morality, how can these be secured without
dogmatic religions? This is the answer so often hurled as
final in their defense. The history of sectarianism shows
anything but a clean bill of morality, as I have already
hinted; if there is any one corner-stone to the edifice of
ethics, it is the honest pursuit of verifiable truth, and that
no dogmatic religion dares to advocate. History shows that
every great reformer of the morals of his day has been
called a schismatic by the Churches.</p>

<p>The arch error is, however, not in these directions, but
in the universal assumption that the moral life, that piety,
is the chief end of man and an object in itself. Nothing
of the kind. The moral law neither exhausts nor completes
the nature of man. It is but one strand in the many-fibred
thread of his existence; and to suspend his whole life and
destiny from this will always, as it always has in the past,
lead to the fall and the destruction of his noblest aspirations.
Piety, a devout morality, the culture of the religious
sentiment, these are only some and far from all of the
means and steps to the highest culture of the individual
life.</p>

<p>They are not individual in the sense that their culture
can be successfully conducted in solitude or by mystical
meditation. True religion never isolates, but unites. Not
the happiness of himself in another world, but the happiness
of others in this, is the aim of the true believer.
From theirs, he derives his own. The “Communion of
Saints,” the “Congregation of the Righteous,” the
<!--180.png--><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 176</span>
“Society of Friends,”&mdash;these are the expressions which
indicate the direction of the religious sentiment in
unimpeded activity. In such “solemn troops and sweet
societies,” it yields that joy to man which his nature is
capable of receiving only in its highest moments of exaltation,
and which it would be sad to think he could ever
be deprived of.</p>

<p>But this we need not fear. A religion that is not afraid
of free investigation, but courts it; one that dismisses the
supernatural because it recognizes that no law can be higher
than that of nature; whose maxim is the utmost veracity
in thought and action at all costs; whose aim is to produce
as much visible happiness and to prevent as much misery
as possible; which binds men together through united
sympathies for these aims; which constantly prompts to
healthful and fruitful activity; which is truly an inspiration,
and sanctifies by its presence the equally true inspirations
of the highest art and the purest science; and whose
clearly recognized purpose is to promote the ideal perfection
of humanity as represented in the individual man;&mdash;this
is the Religion of the Future, and one that the future
will not allow to perish.</p>

<hr />

<p>The aim of science is the Real; of art, the Ideal; of
action, Happiness. It is for religion to unite this trinity
into a unity in each individual life.</p>

<p><!--181.png--><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 177</span></p>
<hr />

<p>Man’s highest efforts in art or thought or life are in
themselves religious, because they represent elements in the
better future life of the race. This is what Michael Angelo
meant when he said, “Who strives after perfection in Art,
strives after something Divine.”</p>

<hr />

<p>The divine is not the superhuman, but the ideally
human. The infinite must become incarnate to be intelligible.
It is so in all great religious acts and works.</p>

<hr />

<p>The ideally true is the potentially true.</p>

<hr />

<p>Physical science is opposed to both religion and metaphysics,
and yet is forever attracted toward them; because,
struggle as it may, in them alone can it find its own
completion.</p>

<hr />

<p>The religious sect that condemns reason, condemns
itself; and the latter sentence is the only one which will
be executed.</p>

<hr />

<p>The poetry of science will be the inspiration of the
religion of the future.</p>

<p><!--182.png--><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 178</span></p>
<hr />

<p>Were there a religion other than human, it could not
appeal to humanity.</p>

<hr />

<p>The human cannot get along without the divine in some
form. The least religious men, such as gamblers, are the
most superstitious. As Novalis says, “Where the gods are
not, ghosts take their place.”</p>

<hr />

<p>The aim of classic religions was the salvation of the
State; of Christianity, the salvation of certain individuals,
the Elect; of the religion of the future, the salvation of
the whole race of man.</p>

<hr />

<p>A religious doctrine should compel belief, like a theorem
in geometry. Most doctrines are accepted because their
believers know too much to disturb their tranquillity by
examining them, or too little to comprehend them.</p>

<hr />

<p>As in dreams the impressions of childhood continue to
recur, so in modern religions conceptions belonging to
the childhood of the race are still urged upon us.</p>

<hr />

<p>The dogmatists prefer to frame rules, rather than give
<!--183.png--><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 179</span>
reasons; because the latter will be judged on their merits,
while the former are accepted on authority.</p>

<hr />

<p>Half-true is harder to refute than wholly false. The
defenders shield themselves behind the part that is true.
Not the mud at the bottom, but the stain in the water,
clouds the stream. This is why numerous sects continue
to survive, perpetuating many errors by means of a few
truths.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is something comical in a man making a business
of religion, levying a charge on this world for his services
to the next. The Quakers must have had a vein of humor
in their opposition to all sorts of paid priests.</p>

<hr />

<p>The priests of the Church of the Future will be the spiritual
leaders of their generation, those educators, poets,
scientists, physicians, journalists, and others, who practice
their avocations with a view to the interests of others as
well as their own.</p>

<hr />

<p>Eating your dinner is as sacred as saying your prayers,
and making your living is as noble as dying for your faith.</p>

<hr />

<p>I heard Walt Whitman once say that life without immortality
would be like a railroad train made up entirely of
<!--184.png--><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 180</span>
engines. The forces of individuality seemed to him too
mighty, to conceive as possible their limitation to this
world.</p>

<hr />

<p>The spirit of Christ’s teachings is too democratic to be
in hearty sympathy with either science, philosophy, art,
or the pursuit of pleasure.</p>

<hr />

<p>Piety is sometimes merely the last passion; sometimes
merely the last fashion.</p>

<hr />

<p>The devout are the disappointed.</p>

<hr />

<p>Prayer refreshes and relieves the mind by strengthening
the confidence, by diverting the thoughts, and by admonishing
the soul of higher themes. The Jew prays to
Jehovah, most Christians to the Virgin or the Saints, the
Buddhist to himself; all are consoled and benefitted;
equally so is he who meditates on the laws, the life, the
love, and the power, manifested in the universe of matter
and mind around him.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> <span class="title">The Cultivation of Our Individuality.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">When you tell a person that he resembles so-and-so, he
is always surprised. He does not see the slightest similarity.
Were he to meet his double in the street, he would pass
him without recognition. It would be the same with his
mental counterpart; in fact, most men are so slightly
acquainted with themselves, and are so lost in the crowd,
that they no longer know the way home. They are
merely composite photographs of the people they have
met. Unconscious actors, they speak the words and imitate
the feelings of those around them until they lose the
cue of their own proper parts.</p>

<p>This deplorable lack of Individuality is the fruitful
cause of many a failure and much unhappiness. It arises
from a lack of self-knowledge, self-confidence, and self-respect,
and is constantly leading men astray in their plans
of life.</p>

<p>The complaint is often made that men deceive each
other; but they deceive themselves far more. They imagine
they have talents which they do not possess, and overlook
those which are their own; they attempt what is beyond
their powers, and allow those they have to rust through
want of use. They believe that is their own which they
<!--186.png--><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 182</span>
have but borrowed, and go forth to till imaginary fields,
leaving their own garden-plots lie fallow.</p>

<p>How much better to live one’s own life, to be oneself,
to cultivate what abilities we have rather than to waste
time on those we have not, to learn the limits of our own
capacities and insure success by working within them! The
advice of the sages of all times has been to swear by the
words of no teacher, to call no man Master, to think our
own thoughts, to be true to ourselves, to make our own
felicity, and not to run about the world trying to share that
of others by aping their sentiments and actions.</p>

<p>The greatest teachers have not desired disciples, but
friends. They have never exerted authority, and where
they could not persuade or convince, they have sought no
proselytes. To them the independance of the individual
mind has been of more importance than the dissemination
of any article of faith or element of instruction. Spinoza,
Herder, Wilhelm von Humboldt, our own Emerson, have
all in spirit joined with Goethe in singing that the secret
of the highest happiness of man rests in the preservation
of his own free personality:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Peer in this august company, deeper than any in his devotion,
speaking at every hazard, I name my late friend,
Walt Whitman, the “singer of one’s self,” “chanter of
Personality,” “self-balanced for all contingencies,” holding
creeds and schools in abeyance, ceasing not till death.</p>

<p><!--187.png--><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 183</span>
The man of independent mind and strong personality is
never trivial or vulgar, no matter what his education or
social position. The artist who plays solo commands our
attention. The plant which is indigenous is alone strong
and hardy; exotics are starvelings. Individuality is contagious,
and it is bracing and stimulating to meet such a
character. His presence is a benefit to a whole company,
and a company of such is worth a regiment of nonentities.
The richest agricultural community I ever saw was in
France, where every peasant cultivated his own little field;
and the poorest was in our own country, where every man
was trying to feed his cattle on somebody else’s range.</p>

<p>The latter theory, however, is that which is popular to-day.
Dreamers are constantly devising schemes by which
the idle and incompetent may live off the proceeds of the
diligent; labor unions deprive their members of the liberty
of speech and the liberty of work; socialism would reduce
all to a common level; syndicates and trusts break down
individual enterprise; sectarian colleges limit their calls to
professors who will echo their tenets; and thus in all
directions the free growth of the individual is hemmed in
by the hedges of prejudice, tradition, creed, and false
theory.</p>

<p>Many people scarcely know what Individuality is. They
think it means to wear a straw hat in winter, or in some
other way to make oneself conspicuous. This is precisely
what it does not mean. The man who is himself is always
simple and natural; he buys his hat at the hatter’s and allows
<!--188.png--><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 184</span>
the tailor to make his clothes. To act otherwise is affectation
and singularity, not individuality. Simplicity is a
charming characteristic of the strongest minds. It is recorded
of Sir Isaac Newton that he was not distinguished
from other men by any peculiarity, either natural or affected;
upon which Dr. Johnson makes the excellent
remark,&mdash;“Newton stood alone merely because he had left
the rest of mankind behind him, not because he deviated
from the beaten path.” Those who met Robert Browning
for the first time were agreeably surprised to find the great
poet was in ordinary society simply a gentleman. All
forms of affectation are confessions that we are not what we
pretend to be, and are inconsistent with true individuality.</p>

<p>Nor is it obstinacy and self-assertiveness, as others suppose.
The man who aims to be himself will wish others to
remain themselves, and will be the last to obtrude his personality
in a disagreeable way upon them. Obedience,
voluntary subjection to the will of others, is part of his
self-training. He who cannot obey, cannot command.
Nor is he one who lives for himself, is solitary or selfish.
The characters who in history shine with the most marked
individuality have been those who moved most actively
among their fellow men.</p>

<p>True individuality is that confidence in self which arises
from a knowledge of one’s own powers, their extent and
their limitations. This knowledge can be obtained only
by experience, by testing the powers, and by gauging their
strength in the contest of life.</p>

<p><!--189.png--><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 185</span>
From how many vexations does a correct estimate of
our capacities free us? Envy, disappointed ambition, premature
exhaustion, disgust of the world, these arise from
inadequate notions of our own abilities. On the other
hand, that life has always a large share of happiness which
is spent in the prosecution of some object to which our
faculties are equal, and which therefore we prosecute with
success.</p>

<p>In judging of our own powers we are just as likely to
under- as to over-estimate them, and the results are equally
painful.</p>

<p>How acute are the sufferings of a diffident, shy, self-distrustful,
over-sensitive disposition! Such a temperament
is a sad make-weight in the struggle of life. More men
fail through ignorance of their strength than through
knowledge of their weakness. They are like a farmer,
who gathers scanty harvests all his life from fields covering
rich deposits of ore, which, did he but work them, would
enrich him. The fear of falling often hinders from climbing.</p>

<p>Let such remember that few score success, but after
failures. Few experiences are indeed more painful than to
devote ourselves earnestly to an undertaking and discover
that it is beyond our powers; but the failure teaches us the
extent of our strength and increases it for the next effort.
We can never learn our own abilities but by trying for what
is beyond them; like the athlete, who lifts heavier and
heavier weights until he reaches those which he cannot
<!--190.png--><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 186</span>
move. Practice and persistence are strong cards. “Time
and I,” said Philip II, “against any other two.”</p>

<p>Much of our sensitiveness, did we but know it, springs
from concealed vanity. We covertly fear that if we display
our powers it will give others the opportunity to take
their measure; and this we mistrust will not prove favorable
to us. But there is a consolation in view. We may
call to mind that as the best of authors do not escape
censure, so the poorest do not lack admirers.</p>

<p>The over-estimation of one’s faculties leads to vanity
and self-conceit, traits not generally painful to the individual,
and not so injurious as excessive diffidence. It
does a youth no harm to believe that he was born to perform
great deeds. It is easier to cut back rank shoots than to
fertilize sterile roots. He who is confident that he can
leap beyond the mark, will be pretty certain to reach it.
Attrition with the world usually reduces vanity to its
proper limits. Disappointed ambition is bitter, but some
bitters are excellent tonics.</p>

<p>That individuality is genuine which is confidence in self,
based on knowledge of self.</p>

<p>Nowhere does it show its worth more than when it comes
into contact with Opinion&mdash;that Queen of the World, as it
has been called. How many are its abject slaves, ordering
their lives and measuring their tastes, not by what they
think right or desirable, but by what society and the world
around them dictate. Pitiable creatures! the only solid
ground of happiness is not what others think of you, but
<!--191.png--><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 187</span>
what you think of yourself; not what they believe you to
be, but what you know you are.</p>

<p>On most subjects a sensible man will be extremely
tolerant. He has differed too often from himself in the
course of his life to be positive with others. He also
knows that opinions may differ, yet not be contradictory.
Most questions have not only two sides, but many sides;
they are polygonal, and, like a table of that shape, can
accommodate many without elbowing. The value of anybody’s
opinion on any subject is much less than is popularly
supposed. The fact, and not the opinion based on it,
is alone of supreme importance. For that reason, what are
called “fixed principles” and “settled convictions” are
signs of mental debility or indolence. I think it is Ruskin
who says that he would be ashamed of himself if he
entertained the same opinions on any subject which he did
twenty years ago. It would be a sign of ossification of
the intelligence.</p>

<p>The characteristic of true individuality is a readiness to
adopt the views of others on proper evidence, and not
obstinacy, as many think. A certain flexibility of opinion
strengthens personality; as the free swaying to and fro of
the branches of a tree toughens the fibres of its trunk.</p>

<p>Obstinate asseveration is usually a sign of ignorance or
falsehood. The man who swears he is telling you the
truth is generally lying. When you see men in violent
discussion about subjects of which they cannot know much,
such as religion or politics, take a seat and laugh. They
<!--192.png--><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 188</span>
are the fools in the Comedy of Life, and the spectacle is
humorous.</p>

<p>It is proverbial that argument never convinces, but
leaves each side more strongly confirmed in its opinions.
Not thus do the shrewd makers of converts go about their
work. They well know that the timely hint, the insidious
suggestion, the light touch, leaves the permanent impression;
like the brands of animals, which to be lasting must
scorch only the superficial layers of the skin, and if burnt
deeper, are obliterated by the healing of the wound.</p>

<p>That form of opinion which is called Advice has much
to do with our felicity. If a man fails, the usual explanation
is that he refused to take advice. Advice which is
the expression of the general results of human action&mdash;such
as is supplied in such abundance in this volume&mdash;is
worthy of consideration; but that which is offered to meet
particular cases is generally worth about what it costs to
give,&mdash;nothing. Advice is never as wise as it seems.
Usually it is claimed to be the fruit of experience; but
we may know the world ever so well to-day, and to-morrow
our knowledge will be out of date. Good advice
usually loses good opportunity. Even if by rejecting
it we fail, the loss may not be real. Sometimes the
money we lose turns out to be that which was best
invested.</p>

<p>One of the choicest fruits of the culture of individuality
is Decision of Character. Nothing more constantly contributes
to the happiness of life. This has been so well
<!--193.png--><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 189</span>
shown by John Foster in his essay on the subject that I
shall do better by the reader to persuade him to peruse it,
than to enlarge on the subject here. The state of indecision,
vacillation, and uncertainty, in which many persons
pass a good share of their waking hours, is reason enough
for the unhappiness of which they complain. The habit
of decision can be readily acquired by making it a rule to
decide promptly on small matters, and not allowing them
again to occupy the attention.</p>

<p>I do not esteem highly the spirit of that Arab proverb
which says,&mdash;“What you wish to conceal from your enemy,
tell not to your friend;” but there is a certain reserve
which every person of strong character instinctively observes
toward even his intimates. It is not secretiveness,
and still less taciturnity or dissimulation. Rather it is the
sense of the sacredness of personality, and is the nucleus
of that lofty sense of Self-reverence, which is the worthiest
feeling one can entertain toward himself. There are

<p>Such reticence in no wise interferes with Sincerity of
character. This is beyond all else the trait of the person
of marked individuality. He alone can be sincere; not

that other, who borrows his opinions from those around
him, and is a mere dealer in other men’s goods, and
hence has none of his own to offer as security for what he
says.</p>

<p>The casuists love to argue that veracity is a relative quality;
that half a lie often conveys a more correct impression
than the whole truth; that to show the seamy as well as the
shiny side of great characters is an injury to the community;
that courtesy obliges us to chicane with facts; that
limping morality itself is much assisted by the friendly
hand of mendacity. These questions may be left to the
conscience of each to work out for himself; but about one
kind of veracity there should be no quibbling, and that is,
veracity to oneself. Deceive others if you will; but never
try to persuade yourself that you are what you are not, or
have what you have not. How can you expect to succeed
in making yourself happy, if you studiously attempt to
remain ignorant of the nature, capacities, and qualities
which you aim to please?</p>

<p>Finally, the foundation of Individuality must be broad,
if the edifice is to be solid. One must constantly have in
view the symmetrical development of all the powers and
faculties. He must seek many-sidedness in his knowledge
and in his sympathies. All the facettes of his nature must
be polished through use. Narrow views, petty interests,
routine, paucity of affections, these must be avoided would
he so develop his nature as to derive from it the utmost
enjoyment in life.</p>

<p>The man of strong personality is not apt to perceive

<p class="center muchlarger">How far our Happiness depends
on Others.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <span class="title">What Others Give Us: Safety, Liberty,
Education.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">A student of human affairs has observed that it is very
difficult to find happiness within oneself, and impossible
to discover it elsewhere. Were the witticism reversed
it would be equally true. “Imperfect happiness,” observes
the philosopher Kant, “arises from man’s <em>unsocial</em>
passions.” Man’s only enemy is man, but he is also his
only ally. In the pursuit of happiness each must aid
himself with all his might, but all his might will prove of
no avail without the aid of others.</p>

<p>The well-being of the individual depends directly on
the social organization around him. From it alone can
he obtain safety, freedom, and the means of knowledge;
in return, it demands respect for its rules,&mdash;that which we
call Morality.</p>

<p><!--200.png--><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 196</span>
For security, safety, man is absolutely dependent on
his fellows, on society. Deprived of it, a prey to well-grounded
fears, he can neither develop his own powers nor
enjoy the fruit of his labors. If you know the bloodhounds
are on your track, the most beautiful landscape
will lose its attractions. When the courtier Damocles
praised Dionysius to his face as the happiest man on earth,
the tyrant seated the sycophant at a luxurious repast with a
sword suspended above his head by a single hair. The
story is familiar to all, because its moral is a universal
truth. The king stood alone on the giddy height of his
power, and the dread of the inevitable fall was the
vampyre that sucked the blood from all his pleasures and
left them corpses before his eyes.</p>

<p>Men have always felt that the only security is to become
members of a social organization. The savagest horde
has its own, its totem, clan, or gens. But in pursuit of
safety, men are apt to sacrifice freedom. To escape the
fire, they plunge into the water; but neither element is
their right abode. Society stands opposed to the individual.
It governs by rules and averages, demands conformity,
restricts liberty, dislikes personality.</p>

<p>Thus arises the ceaseless struggle, to and fro, over the
earth, through all history, between the social and the
individual theories of happiness. The constitution of
the ideal civil society should realize the conditions necessary
for the highest personal enjoyment. But where do
we find such a constitution? Not even in theory have
<!--201.png--><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 197</span>
we reached it. On the one side are the moral tyrants,
afflicted with what Mirabeau called the mania of governing,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la fureur de gouverner</i>, who would make men
happy against their will by prescribing for them what
they should eat and what they should drink, on what
days they should work and on what days play. Over
against them is the camp of the disclassed, unable to
govern themselves, and, therefore, hating to be governed
by any.</p>

<p>Both are equally impotent to the end both profess.
Nothing but a distorted growth can result from a conformity
to moral standards brought about by external compulsion.
Only what a man does or leaves undone of his
own free will develops and strengthens his nature. Freedom
makes him a man, compulsion an animated machine.
Good soldiers are not trained by fighting behind ramparts,
but by exposure in the field to the enemy. What if some
perish in the fray? The success of the day is cheaply
bought by the fall of the few.</p>

<p>Limitations, restrictions, however, there must be, and
that man alone is truly a freeman who recognizes and
respects them. Liberty is not lawlessness; it is the ability
to make the law our servant and not our master, an ability
which we must acquire through our own efforts. The
rights of men are equal, but they can enjoy them only so
far as they qualify themselves so to do. All citizens of the
United States have an equal right to pre-empt a portion of
the public domain; but to secure the land they must make
<!--202.png--><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 198</span>
certain personal efforts. So it is with all other social
advantages and conditions of happiness; men deserve
them only so far as they cultivate a capacity for them; and
not equality, but justice in their distribution, must be the
final aim of every sane social compact.</p>

<p>The only use of this excellent government of ours, or of
any other on the face of the earth, is&mdash;what? The preservation
of your liberty and mine. Nothing else. Never
forget this. Any government is worth paying a dollar to
support, or lifting a finger to defend, only so far as it
secures to each woman and man her or his greatest possible
personal liberty. To the extent that it falls short of
this or goes beyond it, it is worthless and an enemy. The
limits of a government are plain enough, when we thus
define them from the vantage-ground of individual freedom.
It should protect from external enemies and internal
dissensions, and from violence to person or property;
it should enforce justice between man and man, and
woman and man; it should extend its direct care to the
weak, the immature, and the incapable; and it should
supply to all the means of self-culture, of education, in
its widest sense. Here its action should end. All else
should be left to the individual.</p>

<p>There is another theory of government than this. It
would treat all men as if they never come of age, or
remain forever feeble-minded. It would supply them with
work, take care of their pay, dictate their amusements, prohibit
doubtful indulgences, and deliver from temptations by
<!--203.png--><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 199</span>
removing them. Such a government would make grown-up
children, not men. It is the ideal of all priests, of
most women, and of dreamers. It has at times been partially
realized, and always with disastrous results to the
strength of the individual character. I have seen more
drunken men in one week in the State of Maine, where
the sale of intoxicants is prohibited, than during three
months in Italy, where their sale is unrestricted.</p>

<p>The advocates of all such attacks on personal liberty&mdash;be
they priests or social dreamers&mdash;are not less opposed to free
thought than to free action. The defense of their opinions,
not the discovery of truth, is to them the purpose of
research. The logical ultimatum of the one is the stake,
of the other the dynamite bomb. Both would restrict the
untrammeled and unbiased pursuit of knowledge.</p>

<p>Knowledge, however, is the twin brother of liberty and
the provider for the treasury of happiness. Much more
than a fine phrase is the poet’s line, that “He is a freeman,
whom the truth makes free.” Not what he is, or
what he has, but what he <em>knows</em>, gives the individual real
power, and, through power, freedom and the ability to use
it for the gratification of his desires through the unrestricted
employment of his faculties.</p>

<p>The materials of knowledge are represented by the degree
of civilization possessed by a nation. Their distribution
should be through education&mdash;unbiased, secular, universal&mdash;co-extensive
with the demand of the governed, equal to both
sexes. This is within the plain province of government.
<!--204.png--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 200</span>
Children cannot educate themselves, and ignorant parents
see no need of learning. Yet the period of childhood is
the golden age for instruction. It is the epoch of permanent
impressions, dear and indelible, like the initials of
a loved one cut on the bark of a young beech, remaining
legible even when the solid heart of the aged tree is
decayed.</p>

<p>Inertia denies the possibility of improvement. Obscurantism
dislikes it. Let them pass on. Whatever a man
is, there is the power for better within him; we know not
how much better. Faculties trained turn from bad to
good. What is a weed in the fields becomes a flower in
the garden. The State cannot afford to leave education to
the people. Grass grows of itself, but grain needs tillage.</p>

<p>How strongly this is shown in the lamentable education
of women in all civilized countries! Sedulously confined
to empty accomplishments and conventional moralities,
they are everywhere found to be the chief supporters of
decaying dogmas, serfs to social opinion, frittering away
their lives in vanities which men have left centuries behind
them. Both sexes are to blame for this. Men love to rule,
and they fear the increased knowledge which freedom
would bring to women; and women are jealous of the
eminence which learning gives a sister and seek to belittle
its value.</p>

<p>What if I refer again and again to this subject? I have
too often witnessed the exceeding unhappiness of women
in all grades of society not to have it frequently in my
<!--205.png--><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 201</span>
thoughts. They are more unhappy than men, as I have
said before, and I believe it is mainly because they are
worse educated. I know the instruction in the best schools
for girls in the United States, and to what is it directed?
To two ends, to be “good,” and to shine in society.
What they should be taught is to understand the hygiene
of their own bodies, to take care of their own money, to
govern their decisions by justice and reason and not by
impulse, to occupy their thoughts with facts and not with
fiction, and, more than all, to be independent in thought
and deed, and not to allow either society or sentimentality
to cast the final vote in the direction of their actions.</p>

<p>Such doctrine may sound heretical; so I hasten to
bring to its support a reputable endorser in the person of a
clergyman of the Church of England, that writer who so
charmingly combines the best of humor with the best of
sense, the Rev. Sydney Smith. I take it from his essay on
“Female Education,” an essay that ought to be read and
pondered by every woman in the land, the whole burden
and spirit of which is expressed in the following most
pregnant sentence,&mdash;“The happiness of woman will be
increased in proportion as education gives to her the habit
and the means of <em>drawing her resources from herself</em>.”</p>

<p>How much better this than the following insufferable
twaddle of Thomas de Quincey: “It is more in harmony
with the retiring graces of their sexual character
that they should practice a general rule of submission to
<!--206.png--><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 202</span>
the traditional belief of their own separate Church, even
when that belief has long been notoriously challenged as
erroneous”? He is in earnest, too; and the late Poet
Laureate in “In Memoriam” said nearly the same. Blind
leaders of the blind! who think that falsehood and ignorance
are going to point the way to light and truth.</p>

<p>The fact is, the moral side of woman has been educated,
and thus educated, out of all proportion to her other faculties.
What is not “very stuff of the conscience” makes
little or no impression on her. The Good, the Fit, the
Conventional are for her the True; which is a grievous
error, and retards her real progress.</p>

<p>Education is not only the foundation for happiness; it
should and it can be made a pleasure in itself. This will
sound strange to those who are principally familiar with
such institutions of education as those of the Mr. Squeers
or Dr. Blimber type. But the schoolmaster has himself
been to school, and after flogging children for several
thousand years, and thereby developing a healthy hatred
of books which it is a wonder did not hurl the race back
into barbarism, he has learned from Froebel and Pestalozzi
and others that it is actually possible for a sane mind to
study with pleasure if the chance is offered. Indeed, a
learned writer who has many admirers in this country, Mr.
Herbert Spencer, is able to say,&mdash;“The usual test of
political legislation&mdash;its tendency to promote happiness&mdash;is
beginning to be the test of legislation for the school and
<!--207.png--><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 203</span>
the nursery;” and elsewhere,&mdash;“As a final test by which
to judge any plan of culture should come the question,&mdash;Does
it create a pleasurable sensation in the pupil?”</p>

<p>This is good counsel; but, like many good things, it is
also old. Two thousand years ago or so Plato wrote,&mdash;“In
education, direct boys to what amuses their minds.”</p>

<p>Security, liberty, and the means of knowledge,&mdash;these,
therefore, are the conditions of happiness which every
government should, and all in some measure do, offer the
individual. For them, he is entirely dependent on others.
In whatever delusion to the contrary his ignorance or his
arrogance may plunge him, he can obtain these inestimable
benefits in no other way than through the social
organization, and he cannot therefore escape his liability
for them. If he denies it or refuses it, the consequences
will be as inevitable as they will be disastrous. He who
wisely consults the conditions which determine his own
happiness will not seek in isolation or self-sufficiency these
elements, which can alone be obtained through the co-operation
of his fellow-man.</p>

<hr />

<p>Social progress is advanced far more by strengthening
the weak than by chastising the wicked.</p>

<hr />

<p>The sense of safety implies not merely absence of fear,
but also freedom of action.</p>

<p><!--208.png--><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 204</span></p>
<hr />

<p>Justice should be the motto of the State; prudence that
of the individual.</p>

<hr />

<p>Self-recognition is a part of happiness; but the recognition
by others of what we pride ourselves upon, is
another and a large part of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Man is a social being; but the true aim of his social
activity is to learn how to be solitary.</p>

<hr />

<p>He who thinks it necessary to seek solitude for self-improvement
often finds there is still one too many
persons present.</p>

<hr />

<p>The purpose of law is liberty; of obedience, independence;
of submission, emancipation.</p>

<hr />

<p>The well-being of the individual, not of the class,
should be the aim of government. It should not be “by
the people for the people,” but by the people for the
person.</p>

<hr />

<p>The true moral education is that which makes every
intellectual question a matter of conscience, and every
matter of conscience an intellectual question.</p>

<p><!--209.png--><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 205</span></p>
<hr />

<p>An explanation which demonstrates the impossibility of
knowing is about as satisfactory as one which imparts the
knowledge desired. But there are some who call everything
incomprehensible which they do not comprehend.</p>

<hr />

<p>Many children and nearly all girls are educated by
equivocations and taught truths by means of falsehoods.
What have the teachers to expect when their pupils discover
this fact?</p>

<hr />

<p>There are a good many branches of education about
which it is sufficient for most to know that they exist.</p>

<hr />

<p>That moral strength is alone real which has been
acquired by repeated exposure to temptation and repeated
successful resistance.</p>

<hr />

<p>We never fully acknowledge to ourselves how very
human we are. We each secretly think that there is something
in us not shared by any other man or woman.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <span class="title">What we Owe Others: Morality, Duty,
Benevolence.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">The much-maligned Epicurus is reported to have delivered
the oracular utterance,&mdash;“The man who is not
virtuous can never be happy;” and poets and moralists
have exhausted their ingenuity in devising variants of
the well-worn line,&mdash;“’Tis virtue only makes our bliss
below.”</p>

<p>Who would have supposed that philosophers should have
been found&mdash;aye, and they of high degree&mdash;who toss overboard
these venerable maxims as antiquated rubbish? Yet
such is the surprising case.</p>

<p>The mighty Kant, tearing away the cobwebs of the
dogmatic philosophy, feared not to declare,&mdash;“There is
not in the moral law the slightest ground for a necessary
connection between Morality and Happiness;” and again,&mdash;“The
goal of a perfect harmony of Desire and Duty
cannot be obtained;” while in our own day the critical
Alexander Bain calmly observes,&mdash;“Happiness and Virtue
are independent aims and not identical. The treatment
of Happiness should be dissevered from that of Ethics.”</p>

<p>Scarcely could the contrast of the new and the old
schools of thought be more vividly displayed than in these
<!--211.png--><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 207</span>
brief quotations. There are some, indeed, who have even
gone farther, and maintained that the pursuit of happiness
and that of virtue are not only independent, but even
incompatible aims; because, writes Dr. Despine, a French
psychologist of repute,&mdash;“Happiness is the satisfaction of
desire, while virtue consists in doing good, not to satisfy
the desire of doing it, but out of a sense of duty, and in
opposition to desire.” This statement, however, overlooks
the existence of a moral sense and the normal pleasure
derived from its gratification.</p>

<p>Morality and the moral sense are not to be confounded.
All men have a love for the beautiful, but nowise agree as
to what is beautiful; and there is just as wide and just as
impassable a gulf between the various conceptions of morals,
although, in all, the moral sense is present.</p>

<p>Morality is nothing more than the conformity of the
individual to the type of the society in which he lives. It
is the recognition of the debt which he owes it for securing
him the privileges of safety, liberty, and education, as I
have explained in the last chapter. Not his own moral
sense, but the society in which he is, lays down the terms
on which that debt is to be paid; and while he feels on
the one side entitled to these rights, he acknowledges, on
the other, his liability for his social duties in exchange for
them.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no such thing as a universal or even
a general code of morality, nor can there be. There is no
act which may not sometimes be right and sometimes be
<!--212.png--><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 208</span>
wrong. I have heard of a French writer, who composed a
work entitled “The Seven Cardinal Sins,” showing how
under certain circumstances every one of them could be
committed by a perfectly virtuous person. I have never
read his book, but I delight in his doctrine. Take the
Decalogue itself, written, as we are told, by the very finger
of Divinity, and there is not a command in it that both
Christian and Jew do not break most virtuously whenever
occasion calls. “Thou shalt not kill;” and all nations
spend more annually in preparations for killing by land
and sea than they do in a generation for institutions of
learning. “Thou shalt not rob;” and Abraham Lincoln
with one glorious stroke of his pen robbed the citizens of
the United States of a hundred million dollars’ worth of
valuable slaves. Truth-telling? The observation of Socrates
in the Symposium still holds good,&mdash;“In speaking of holy
things or persons, there is a general understanding that you
should praise them, not that you should tell the truth about
them;” witness the discussions that come up from time to
time on the characters of “the Fathers of the Republic”
or the books of the Bible.</p>

<p>In every code of morals there is one law for our friends
and another for the rest of the world; our duty to our
family is ever in conflict with our duty to our neighbor;
and our duty to our country is opposed to our duty to
humanity at large. A father who would treat other children
as his own would be deemed unnatural, and a statesman
who consulted the advantages of other nations would
<!--213.png--><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 209</span>
be cast out as a traitor. This is the “dualism of morals,”
and its necessary existence destroys all possibility of a
universal and inflexible code of morals. The antagonism
is not likely to decrease. The most violent contradictions
between the various views of life will be likely to be found
precisely in the highest culture; because there the individual
comes most to his own, and is least willing to sacrifice
his own rights to a society whose claims he disallows.</p>

<p>Men now question the right of society to demand what it
does from them in exchange for the benefits it confers upon
them; and they are right. Society itself must be brought
to the test of the Moral Sense. This faculty is that which
we also call the sense of Duty, or of “the Ought,” or
Conscience. It is a judge, not a lawgiver, and it derives
its right of sitting in judgment from its ancient descent,
dating back to the time when man first gathered together
in hordes or clans under some sheltering rock for mutual
aid. It is as much a part of human nature as is the love
of association, and as such its satisfaction is as essential to
happiness, but is by no means the whole of happiness, as
so many have taught. In fact, it is often enough entirely
absent, as in genuine criminals. It is now well known
that these neither experience remorse for crime nor take
pleasure in well-doing, whatever sentimentalists may say to
the contrary.</p>

<p>The pleasure of the moral sense comes solely from the
satisfaction of itself, and not necessarily, in the least,
from the practice of virtue or benevolence or charity.
<!--214.png--><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 210</span>
The inquisitor, Torquemada, lighting the hellfires of the
Inquisition, the anarchist hurling his bomb into the crowd,
Judith yielding her maiden chastity to the embrace of
Holofernes, all enjoyed the highest pleasure of the moral
sense, because all acted in the complete conviction that
they were doing right.</p>

<p>The man is moral who believes he is so, and the woman
is chaste who considers herself such, no matter what their
actions are. What we think the most fiendish crimes have
been perpetrated by fervent Christians, and there are
religions now numbering millions of intelligent adherents
in which the prostitution of girls is considered a meritorious
act.</p>

<p>When Adam Smith laid down the three requisites for
individual happiness as health, freedom from debt, and a
clear conscience, he framed a sensible prescription; but
should have explained that a clear conscience in nearly all
cases means simply conformity to the standard of our age
and nation, not at all to any higher or abstract ideal. So
far from the devotion to a lofty or unusual virtue bringing
happiness, it always entails proscription, pain, and sorrow
on him who advocates it. The crowd ever cry out,
“Crucify him! Crucify him!” Every one of the noble
army of leaders in ethical progress was in his own day
branded as an infidel, cursed by the Churches, and driven
forth from the enjoyments which a less developed moral
sense would have permitted him to indulge. He who rises
above the law is ever against the law.</p>

<p><!--215.png--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 211</span>
Hence it is that with perfect truth, though with a lurking
satire on the commonplaces of moral doctrine, Professor
Bain writes,&mdash;“To realize the greatest happiness
from virtue we should be careful to conform to the standard
of the time and place, neither rising above nor falling
beneath it; we should make our virtues apparent and
showy, and perform them with the least sacrifice to ourselves;
we should hold our associations with duty, as
well as our natural sympathies with our fellows, only at a
moderate strength.”</p>

<p>In certain natures the satisfaction of the moral sense
yields a happiness worth all sacrifices, just as in others the
feeling of unrestrained liberty will be gratified at the expense
of everything that the majority hold dear. Both are
exceptional, and there are quite as many who suffer nothing
from a violation of the sense of duty or from the loss
of liberty.</p>

<p>No platitude is more erroneous than this,&mdash;“To be
vicious is to be miserable;” for were it so, we should not
have the hordes of the vicious infesting society. Far more
correct is the observation of that acute observer of life,
Vauvenargues, that virtue cannot make the vicious happy,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La vertu ne peut faire le bonheur des méchants</i>. He might
have added that virtue can never make the virtuous happy,
for the really virtuous man is always above the standard of
his time, and is sure to suffer in consequence from the
antagonism he develops, and from his sorrowful appreciation
of the sentiment that prompts it.</p>

<p><!--216.png--><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 212</span>
The education of the moral sense has hitherto been
retarded by two popular but mistaken doctrines; the one
that the moral life is “the chief end of man;” the other
that it means obedience to a code of laws.</p>

<p>Again I repeat that the chief end of man is the symmetrical
development of all his powers and faculties and
the enjoyment which he will derive from their activity,
and not at all the exclusive or preponderant attention to
one or the other element of his nature. His moral sense
is merely the guide of the duties he owes to others, duties
indispensable to his own life and liberty, but by no means
exhaustive of his nature; rather, merely giving him the
opportunity for the higher aim of developing himself. The
moral life is but a means to an end, and not an end in
itself.</p>

<p>The confusion of the moral life with obedience to a
moral code dates back beyond history, and is almost as
active to-day as ever, in spite of the efforts of such teachers
as Buddha and Christ to show the falsity of it. Both proclaimed
the absolute independence of the moral sense from
moral laws. Such laws are either religious, expressing
supposed duties to God, as the Jews believe that He forbade
them to eat pork, or, as they and the Christians, that
He decided that one day in seven is more sacred than
the others; or they are conventional or civil, which are
merely the customs, <em>mores</em>, of the nation or community.</p>

<p>Independent of all these codes, which for the most part
are survivals, and in the present day absurd, are the
<!--217.png--><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 213</span>
Benevolent Emotions, the gratification of which to the
properly developed individual constitutes a large element
of personal happiness. They arise not from a sense of
duty, because they do not have reference to what is due
the social compact, but from sympathy, acquired or inherited.
The relief of the pain of others, the administration
of efficient consolation, the diminution of the sorrows of
those around us, yield to ourselves a pleasurable satisfaction,
a sense of appropriate activity, which is so real that
it is a wonder it is not more diligently cultivated. Too
many, perhaps, look for a part of their return in the gratitude
of those assisted, instead of in the pleasure of the act
itself, and, being disappointed, find the field of charity less
flowery than they anticipated. They commit the common
error of placing the end of enjoyment external to themselves
instead of the means only.</p>

<hr />

<p>The only sure method to distinguish good from evil is
first to learn to discriminate true from false.</p>

<hr />

<p>A sincere lover of truth is never wholly in the wrong;
chiefly because he never claims to be wholly in the right.</p>

<hr />

<p>The finest thought I found in Chamfort’s writings&mdash;and
it is wonderfully fine, deserving to be the motto of every
work on the Art of Happiness&mdash;is this,&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le plaisir peut</i>
<!--218.png--><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 214</span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">s’appuyer sur l’illusion, mais le bonheur repose sur la vérité</i>,
“Errors may yield us Pleasure, but truth alone can give
Happiness.”</p>

<hr />

<p>Only through fulfilling his duties to society can man
secure from society that which is essential to his own welfare.
This is why the inward realization of the moral law
becomes a part of the Art of Happiness.</p>

<hr />

<p>A moral act is simply one which, at the time and under
the special circumstances, is useful to the society in which
it takes place. Hence it has nothing to do with individual
Motive, which is the only Mentor recognized by the
educated moral sense.</p>

<hr />

<p>The ancient Greeks believed that the laws of human
society are laws of nature, and therefore absolute. In
Sophocles’ tragedy, it is no excuse for Œdipus, when he
kills his father and marries his mother, that he does so in
absolute ignorance of the relationship. His remorse and
punishment are not abated.</p>

<hr />

<p>One school of modern writers maintains that all virtues
are but vices disguised; another, that all vices are but
virtues misdirected. As these terms are entirely relative,
both schools are right,&mdash;and wrong.</p>

<p><!--219.png--><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 215</span></p>
<hr />

<p>So long as war is possible, a perfected social life is impossible;
but when Justice will not be listened to in any
lower notes, she must speak through the mouths of cannons.</p>

<hr />

<p>Peace, not happiness, is the reward of virtue.</p>

<hr />

<p>The man who professes duty as the sole guide of his life
is either hypocritical or ignorant.</p>

<hr />

<p>Weaklings and hypocrites like to extol the goodness of
men; the former to allay their own fears, the latter because
it reflects flatteringly on themselves.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is no proof that a sentiment is noble because men are
willing to die for it. More men knowingly sacrifice themselves
to pleasure than to duty.</p>

<hr />

<p>The lines of morality, observed Burke, differ from those
of geometry; they have breadth as well as length, and for
that reason will not form set and angular figures.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <span class="title">The Practice of Business and the Enjoyment
of Society.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">Let us grant that the true aim of the individual is his
own highest development: he can reach it only through
the ministry of his fellow beings. Vain the effort to seek
expansion or happiness apart from his kind. The soul
rusts in solitude; to be bright and keen it requires friction
with others. Alone, it starves and pines, grows misshapen
and distorted; in company, it gives and receives, assists
others, and is in turn assisted. Let us do no injustice to
the balm and the blessings of solitude; but the growth of
the world is due to the blending and the striving of mind
with mind.</p>

<p>The word which expresses this is Association. It conveys
various degrees of intimacy, from the lowest, that of
the ordinary intercourse of Business and Society, through
the increasingly closer ties of Fellowship, Comradeship,
and Friendship, up to that dearest of all, wherein the two
sexes unite to cast the rays of life into the infinite future,
Love and Marriage.</p>

<p>There is nothing in any of these that demands the
sacrifice of the individual. The gauge which marks the
high-water line in them all is one and the same&mdash;the maintenance
<!--221.png--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 217</span>
of the utmost freedom of the individual along
with the utmost sympathy and accordance with the individuality
of others. As it is only through these, through
participation in all of these relations of association, that
the highest degree of personal happiness can be attained,
I shall consider each in turn very briefly, little more than
hinting of those maxims and principles which stand
approved as contributing to a reasonable success and a wise
enjoyment of them.</p>

<p>Dealing with men is the daily business of life; but a
knowledge of human nature, even in this restricted relation,
is the latest knowledge which one acquires.</p>

<p>The first maxim is <em>to distrust</em>.</p>

<p>“All men are liars,” said the Psalmist; and there is no
stronger proof of the saying than that all men deny it.
History and sermons and sympathy combine to conceal or
to modify the truth, in order that we may walk in peace
with our fellow-men. Be it so. But at least, in our own
minds, let us acknowledge facts. We are none the better
ourselves for believing others to be better than they are.
“The transacting of business,” observes Bacon, “is chiefly
a commerce with fools;” my comment upon which is, that
he will be the worst fooled who thinks he is the only wise
man; of which my Lord of Verulam is said to have been a
conspicuous example.</p>

<p>Insincerity has no limit. If a man does not show what
he is when first you meet him, wait a year to decide. The
<!--222.png--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 218</span>
insincere aim most to deceive by what most they show.
Concerning them, therefore, follow the Italian maxim, believe
the incredible and doubt the probable. The very
pious cashier, not the thoughtless clerk, will be the one to
run away with the money.</p>

<p>The second maxim is <em>to trust</em>.</p>

<p>Confidence in others is the corner-stone both of fortune
and felicity. It is the grateful dew which fertilizes the
flowers of sincerity, of truthfulness, and honor; and even
common honesty will wither if exposed to the scalding
breath of suspicion. Reputation lives in the minds of
others, and if we know ours has no fixed abode there, but
is harbored as a doubtful and distrusted intruder, our
staunchest argument for preserving it is gone.</p>

<p>He who can happily combine the oil and vinegar of
these two maxims in his dealings with men, will carry with
him a charm which will guard him from the bitterest disappointments
to which we are liable in the hard contest
for material aims.</p>

<p>Business intercourse we cannot avoid; but we seek it for
other ends than pleasure; social intercourse is that which
we pursue for enjoyment only,&mdash;or, at least, pretend to.
Hence, we call it specifically “Society;” and we distinguish
it into certain fanciful grades, as “good society,”
“the best society,” and “high life.” Men and women
enter it equally, and the spirit of it is held to be apart
from, even quite the reverse of, that of business life.
<!--223.png--><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 219</span>
Many men and all women look upon it as the field in which
the chief victories of their careers must be won and the
main elements of their happiness discovered.</p>

<p>Why sneer at such sentiments? The drawing-room, the
only stage on which the two sexes meet on equal terms, is
the innermost sanctuary of civilization, and the hostess is
high priestess of the shrine. Its development registers the
epochs in the history of culture. Francis I has two
special claims on the praise of posterity; the one, that he
proclaimed himself honored by the friendship of Titian;
the other, that he was the first to admit women to the
court society of France. The drawing-room confers the
last degree in the liberal arts. No education is complete
which has not received its finishing touches at the hands of
a refined woman; and enlightenment will first deserve its
name when her rights are everywhere as much respected
and her influence as freely acknowledged as they are now
in her own parlors.</p>

<p>Good-will is the basis of good society. He who quits
a company, pleased, and conscious of having pleased, is
its model member. There is nothing derogatory in this.
Conceal it as we may, the secret motive of our every
effort is the hope of pleasing somebody else. The interchange
of kindly courtesies and approving expressions is a
commendable pastime. He who prides himself on being
“beholden to nobody” is a pseudo-philosopher. The
true philosopher enjoys society, but is not dependent on
it for his enjoyment.</p>

<p><!--224.png--><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 220</span>
Would-be superior men have inveighed against society
because its members are and must be for the most part
“ordinary people,” and its topics common-place. Really
superior men prefer ordinary people, because, as Goethe so
well said, “They are more human.” Nobody was common-place
to the eye of that great master, because each
represented the species. It is certainly true that in the
long run, and for “human nature’s daily use,” ordinary
people are the most agreeable. We really should not
desire high thinking in high life. People fraternize more
readily on lower levels because they are broader. Nations
gather together on plains, not on mountain tops. These
are suitable for star-gazers and eagle-hunters.</p>

<p>Those who dislike society are usually those who are not
at ease in it, from lack of early training. Few enjoy
dancing who have learned from an awkward master, and a
lifetime is not long enough to comb the hayseed from a
farmer boy’s hair.</p>

<p>The one maxim for success in society is to be agreeable;
and the agreeable man is he who agrees with others.
Society expects persons to offer enjoyment and pleasure, not
improvement. One should accept men as they are and
not seek to change them; it is a less task to adapt yourself
to others than them to you. One that enters a company
that he likes, is liked by it; but nothing is so justly
exasperating as a show of superiority.</p>

<p>The aim of society is to bring about a closer union of
its members by having them meet on planes of thought
<!--225.png--><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 221</span>
and emotion which are common to all. The expression
of discordant ideas and feelings, be they higher or lower,
is, therefore, out of place. On the other hand, a company
is harmonized, and its elements happily fused together, by
some general impression made on all at the same moment,
and the enjoyment of all is correspondingly heightened.
This may be by a strain of music appropriately introduced,
by a few apt remarks on a topic of general interest, or by
the exhibition of curious or beautiful objects. The sense
of a sentiment in common is at once established, and the
company feels that each knows the other better for this
property in commonalty. The skillful hostess knows how
often and by what devices thus to promote the unity of her
guests. Multiply the ties which bind society together and
you multiply the pleasure it yields and the benefits which
are derived from it.</p>

<p>Really good society is not selfish, nor does it encourage
selfishness. Rather it is based on a certain sacrifice of
self. Those circles offer little enjoyment where each aims
at nothing but his own; amusement is absent where no
one endeavors to amuse others. Nor is it unjustly censorious.
Its judgments are generally recognized as fair,
and nothing so fortifies the moral sense as the approval of
the society in which one is accustomed to move; while
the terrors of the Hereafter are small compared to its disapproval.
The stoutest minds have acknowledged this.
“Who can see worse days,” asks Bacon, “than he who
yet living doth follow at the funeral of his own reputation?
<!--226.png--><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 222</span>
I can desire no greater place than in the front of good
opinion.”</p>

<p>It is quite true that this power, like that of all irresponsible
autocrats, is sometimes abused to the injury of the
worthy; but the harm is slight compared to the results
which are good. True, also, that general society is a poor
test of a man’s real nature. One may possess many agreeable
qualities and yet fail to be agreeable, through lack
of good taste or early training in their use under social
conditions. Or, again, though a kindly disposition makes
a man popular, it by no means follows because a man is
popular that he has a kindly disposition. We must accept
society with these deficiencies, for in spite of them all it is
a potent auxiliary in the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>Genuine kindliness of heart,&mdash;this is the sweetest trait
of human nature. Unfortunately, it is one of the rarest;
so that society, which appreciates it so highly that it
cannot exist without at least its semblance, substitutes for
it&mdash;Politeness.</p>

<p>Though a semblance only, it is a noble counterfeit.
Urbanity presages perfected Humanity. It is the outward
and visible sign of what should be the inward and spiritual
nature. It is a prophecy of the Golden Age and is based
on the Golden Rule. When some one asked Aristotle
how we should conduct ourselves toward our associates, he
replied,&mdash;“We should treat them as we wish them to treat
us.”</p>

<p>Politeness is the only currency which costs nothing and
<!--227.png--><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 223</span>
buys much. Its tenders are counters and yet pass as coin.
Who but a fool, therefore, would refuse to use them liberally?
Such fools there are, however, and in abundance.
It is a key which has the pleasant power of both closing
the doors below and opening those above us; for there is
no bar to the unwelcome familiarity of inferiors equal to
scrupulous politeness, and no passport so sure to the esteem
of our superiors in age or station.</p>

<p>Cheap as it is, it is too precious to be wasted, and like
the free gifts of nature, water or sunlight, there are occasions
when it must be doled out in small quantities, and at
all times be dispensed with a provident hand. Few social
blunders are more painful than to display a warmth of
manner which is not reciprocated; and there are rude
natures who cannot distinguish kindliness of behavior from
weakness of purpose.</p>

<p>The common lien of society is Talk; and the talk must
be essentially small talk. No greater blunder could be
committed than to suppose that society wants, or ought to
want, Conversation, in the dignified sense of that term, in
which an idea is introduced and expanded, a proposition
developed, or an argument stated. Nothing of the sort.
“The best conversation,” observes Mr. Malloch, “is
never worth remembering.” Perhaps he had in his mind
the remark of Talleyrand, who said that the finest converser
he ever heard was his own mother, but that he was
unable to recall a single pointed or brilliant expression
she had used.</p>

<p><!--228.png--><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 224</span>
Small talk is in society what small change is in the
daily affairs of life,&mdash;you need it twenty times for your
gold-piece once. It is no such easy matter to master the
art of it. To talk much and to say little one must be very
clever or a fool; and the still higher art of putting others
to their best paces, so that you act only as starter in the
race while others win the purse, asks an amount of tact
which is equaled only by the self-denial involved.</p>

<p>The expert in talk will aim to please and not to instruct;
he will not disturb the convictions of elderly persons who
have made up their minds; nor the self-complacency of
any by a display of superiority, especially in his judgment
or reasoning powers; if he boasts, it will be of his luck
and not of his cleverness; he may compliment a woman
on her beauty, but never a rich man on his riches; he will
contradict only those who disparage themselves, and if he
dips into a deep question, he will only stir it and not
settle it; he will avoid allusions to his own ailments, but
sedulously inquire about those of others; but his chief aim
will be to find out first whether the person whom he
addresses prefers to talk or to listen, and scrupulously let
him have his way.</p>

<hr />

<p>When all are of one mind, what is left to say worth
hearing?</p>

<hr />

<p>Save your best thoughts for your best friends.</p>

<p><!--229.png--><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 225</span></p>
<hr />

<p>Frivolity is the armor of good society, worn to protect
it against the violence of passions and the ennui of enthusiasms.</p>

<hr />

<p>Subservience to society is in man what “protective
mimicry” is in insects,&mdash;an unconscious tendency to
imitation for the purpose of self-preservation.</p>

<hr />

<p>Youth looks to be received in society with greater sympathy
than it finds; age will find more than it generally
expects.</p>

<hr />

<p>Acquaintances rate us first at the value we put on ourselves;
later at the value we prove to them.</p>

<hr />

<p>Those who visit you, find out how you live; you must
visit them to find out how they live.</p>

<hr />

<p>Forgive if you can, but do not forget. Characters
change little, and a base action is a landmark worth remembering.</p>

<hr />

<p>A lie comes readier in society than in solitude; but for
all that, it is easier to deceive oneself than others.</p>

<hr />

<p>Only those of violent prejudices violently attack the
prejudices of others.</p>

<p><!--230.png--><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 226</span></p>
<hr />

<p>It is a rule in polite society not to refer to three subjects&mdash;a
man’s false hair, his religion, or his politics; and for
the same reason&mdash;because neither is his own, but merely
borrowed from others.</p>

<hr />

<p>Curious inconsistency! People talk willingly about their
physical ailments, but unwillingly about their moral defects;
though the former cannot be mended by discussing
them, and the latter might be.</p>

<hr />

<p>Silence is often sanatory. There are subjects, thoughts,
and memories which, like certain bodily functions, cannot
be avoided, but should not be talked about.</p>

<hr />

<p>Reserve is a great help to reputation. I know a shallow
scientist who has gained a fine position mainly owing to
his knack of leaving his hearers with the impression that
he knows much more than he has told.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is a noble trait to be above the temptations of
fortune; but those who care least about money are not
therefore the most honest.</p>

<hr />

<p>Nothing is more interesting than self-revelation; nor
more tedious than self-publication.</p>

<p><!--231.png--><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 227</span></p>
<hr />

<p>If you avoid disagreeable people, and cease thinking
about them, for you they will have no existence.</p>

<hr />

<p>Society is the jury impaneled to try the causes of which
the law takes no cognizance.</p>

<hr />

<p>The worst of an unfounded accusation is its foundation.</p>

<hr />

<p>Never hit at a hornet unless you are sure of killing it.
Never notice a social scandal about yourself unless you
can refute it absolutely. A weak defense is more damaging
than silence.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is a much admired art to turn the weaknesses of others
to our own profit. How sublime would be the science which
would direct their strength to their own true interests!</p>

he can measure himself by other standards than himself,
but all his circuits lead him home again; his most positive
knowledge is of himself, and by analogy of his own kind.
With a wise recognition of the limits of his own nature he
should seek happiness in the conditions of existence known
to him and especially among his own species, where alone he
can find beings whose endowments are the same, and whose
affinities and sympathies respond to his own.</p>

<p>Society, as I have said, is the common field of intercourse
in civilized life, and it makes for itself its own
various limitations and restrictions. Other methods of
Association are based on quite different principles, but have
all been organized with the aim of increasing happiness,
and all therefore deserve the cultivation of him who is
sedulous about his own. The two motives which give
them origin are, the one, Interest; the other, Sympathy.
The former I may call Fellowships; the latter, Comradeships.</p>

<p>Fellowships, composed of those who <em>follow</em> the same
business, trade, or profession, and thus have an interest in
<!--233.png--><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 229</span>
common,&mdash;this is what the word means. They are the
guilds, unions, lodges, clubs, societies, associations, companies,
which swarm so in our day, whose members are held
together by a desire of mutual assistance in making money,
or raising wages, or providing against misfortune, or maintaining
privileges, or buying cheap, or paying each other’s
funeral expenses, or in a thousand other ways advancing
the interests, and thus relieving the burdens and increasing
the enjoyment, of their members. I knew a man who
belonged to over three hundred such associations, and as
he was in other respects a sensible person, he probably
found a profit in this multiplication of ties.</p>

<p>It is a discovery of modern times of no mean importance
that after several thousand years of open trial, government
and religion and friendship and love have all
failed in relieving the misery of human life, but that the
intelligent recognition of the mutuality of interests does
not fail; and, when properly organized, may be counted
on with utmost confidence to prevent most of the disasters
and to secure most of the essential material blessings of
life,&mdash;far beyond the dreams of the most sanguine reformers
of earlier generations. There is no reason why we should
have the poor always with us, except the ignorance of men
as to their own material interests or their indifference to
them; and these difficulties must in time diminish, if not
disappear. Through association for mutual aid in buying
and selling, in labor and investment, in defense and
assistance, in credit and insurance, and the like, the date
<!--234.png--><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 230</span>
is almost calculable when the deserving poor will as a class
no longer exist, and extreme indigence will mean either
idleness or crime.</p>

<p>The rock on which most such schemes have shattered
has been that in their blind effort at mutuality they have
overlooked the prime import of individuality&mdash;the freedom
and autonomy of each member. It should never be forgotten
that the only value of any scheme of association is
the development of the individual. Any society which
does not make this its first and clearly announced purpose
is doomed to a deserved failure. There is no sentiment in
such associations. They classify men like bricks or boxes,
according to the externals or accidents of their professions
or places. They pay no heed to personality beyond the
one element in it which they are formed to take cognizance
of. For that very reason they are apt to demand disproportionate
sacrifices for this, and to encroach on liberty
by unjust demands on the member’s time, labor, leisure, or
money. They are liable to reach a point where the benefits
they confer are not worth the sacrifices they require.
This is the history of many labor unions in the United
States, and it is the characteristic of all the so-called
socialistic schemes for improving society. In all of them
society is looked upon as paramount to the individual,
instead of the individual as paramount to society; whereas,
his development is that alone for which society has any
right to exist.</p>

<p>Comradeship differs from Fellowship as social does from
<!--235.png--><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 231</span>
business life. In it there is no question of interests in
common, but only of tastes in common&mdash;a mutuality
which exists often to the sad injury of interests. Comrades
are birds of a feather, who assemble because they resemble&mdash;in
accordance with the French proverb, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui se rassemblent,
s’assemblent</i>. They all like dogs, or whist, or yachts,
or music, or old books, or four-in-hands, or spectral
analysis,&mdash;any of the occupations of choice which are
pursued for the pleasure they yield.</p>

<p>In modern life this form of Association has largely taken
the place of Friendship as it was understood by the ancients.
It is better adapted to the bustle and scurry of
these days, when the busy worker has not time to cultivate
the amenities of sentiment, but desires to find others who
share his favorite tastes, and a ready-made sympathy which
he need not be at the trouble of looking after, but which is
always at hand when he wants it. This he finds in such
comradeships, where each comes because he has likings
similar to the others, and is therefore sure to be a pleasant
arrival. Each thus gratifies his own taste and increases its
capacity for gratification; for tastes are like magnets,&mdash;the
more they are used the stronger becomes their power of
attraction.</p>

<p>The higher grades of comradeship are seen in artistic,
literary, and scientific societies, which pursue their objects
for the love of the subject, and not for commercial or
other material ends. The intellectual communion which
they yield to their members is a pleasure of a very high
<!--236.png--><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 232</span>
order, and an additional and valuable advantage which
they possess is that they bring workers in the same fields
of unselfish pursuits together, soften the asperities which
ignorance of each other’s personalities might allow to
remain, and often pave the way for warm and abiding
friendships. Those men of science or artists who hold
themselves aloof from such reunions usually do so through
self-distrust or undue sensitiveness, and sin both against
their own happiness and the prosperity of their favorite
employment.</p>

<p>Both the religious and the moral life&mdash;they are not the
same&mdash;should find their chief activity in the sphere of
comradeship. It was the beautiful ideal of George Fox
that the Church of the future should be a Society of
Friends. The ideal is too lofty for human nature; but it
is quite possible and should be a daily occurrence that the
members of a church or a society united for the development
of the benevolent or religious sentiments should
display as much mutual good feeling and as warm a personal
interest in the common purpose, as, say, dog-fanciers
who belong to the same kennel club.</p>

<p>Friendship is far rarer than Comradeship, because it is
more delicate and requires a higher type of character.
Most men are incapable of it, and therefore cannot distinguish
it from a mere community of tastes. It goes much
farther, embracing the whole nature, and lifting the
relation out of the plane of interests or tastes into that of
sentiment and spiritual sympathy. No one is capable of
<!--237.png--><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 233</span>
friendship who thinks what use he can make of it. Friendship
is free trade, and knows neither charity, robbery, nor
reciprocity. It keeps neither a debit nor a credit account,
and it leaves no room for ingratitude, because the credit of
each party is unlimited.</p>

<p>The completest friendship is that in which the utmost
sympathy is united with the utmost independence. The
differences must not be so great as to prevent a thorough
understanding, nor so small as to do away with admiration
for the personal qualities of each other, and some desire to
emulate them.</p>

<p>These phrases do not mean that we should look for perfection
in friends. Quite the contrary. What could be
more fatiguing than perfection? Its monotony would be
unendurable. The affection for friends is not a tribute
paid to their merits. Their very faults often endear them.
We do not wish them removed. For ourselves, it may be
well to retain some of those defects which give our friends
pleasure; though this is to be taken with reserve; for, on
the other hand, a great charm in a friend is that he brings
us not what we expected, but something equally pleasant
which we did not expect.</p>

<p>Friendship is strengthened by a certain amount of reserve.
Few persons, to use the slang of the studio, “strip
well.” Every one gains by veiling some of his parts. For
the same reason we should not ask nor desire complete
confidence from a friend. There are always secrets which
it is better not to know. We may inquire the cause of his
<!--238.png--><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 234</span>
despondency, for sympathy and aid are natural to the
sentiment of friendship; but should wait to be told the
sources of his elation.</p>

<p>In a similar manner absence for not too long a time
strengthens friendship by allowing its value to be felt, and
the imagination to clothe the absent in some of the fanciful
and beautiful garbs of the ideal. But too prolonged a stay
leaves friendship a memory rather than a passion.</p>

<p>“But what!” some one will exclaim. “Are we to set
about making and keeping friends with the same attention
as if we were raising hot-house fruit?” Yes, precisely so;
but if a friend is not in your estimation worth as much as
a bunch of Hamburg grapes, I assure you it will be time
wasted for you to try. When people complain that they
have no friends, inquire what efforts they have made to
get and keep them. True friendship is rare because it is
rarely sought for. When Lord Bacon wrote, “There is
little friendship in the world, and least of all between
equals,” the great Chancellor unwittingly testified to the
truth of those charges of perfidy which posterity has
brought against his name. Friends must be diligently
sought for, and when found must be sedulously cherished.
Dr. Johnson never said a wiser word than when he gave
the advice, directed especially to those who are advancing
in years, “to keep our friendships in constant repair.”</p>

<p>Such a relation of sentiment between men can scarcely
be formed in later life. As trees grow old their fibres
become rigid, and their branches cannot be interlocked to
<!--239.png--><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 235</span>
arch a bower. But, by a delightful compensation of
nature, it is precisely at this period of life that the sweetest
friendships of all are formed&mdash;those between men and
women. Some have doubted these, and I grant you most
are incapable of them; but in facts and friendships there
is no such thing as gender. There are too many beautiful
examples in history to allow room for scepticism here.</p>

<p>Need I count them? Need I refer to the friendship
between Chateaubriand and Madame Recamier, extending
over thirty years, during which she was the guide, consoler,
and confidante of the great statesman and author; not as a
learned woman,&mdash;for that she was not,&mdash;but as a truly
sympathetic soul? Need I quote from that charming
volume of letters, the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Briefe an eine Freundin</i>, which
testify to the long, the loving, and the pure bond that
united Wilhelm von Humboldt to Charlotte Diede?</p>

<p>Or is there occasion to dwell on that instance which
enshrines elements of sweetness even beyond these, the
friendship between Michael Angelo and Vittoria Colonna?
Think of the inspired and self-centred artist, living alone
with his dreams of matchless beauty, meeting no man
worthy of admittance even to the threshold of his affections,
he who could write from Rome to his nephew in
Florence, “I have no friends; I need none and wish
none;” finding at last in the noble and tender soul of
this distinguished woman the sentiments and sympathy
for which he had been unconsciously longing, and which
<!--240.png--><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 236</span>
were necessary to complete the symmetry of both his own
life and hers!</p>

<hr />

<p>The burden laid on Beauty is, that it can have many
lovers but no friends.</p>

<hr />

<p>A very positive character is at first pleasing. We ourselves
are troubled by so many problems that it is a relief
to think,&mdash;“Here is one who has solved them all.” But
we soon find that such characters merely slam the door in
the face of importunate inquiries.</p>

<hr />

<p>Men’s characters are polar forces; the stronger they
repel some, the stronger they attract others.</p>

<hr />

<p>The society of those who enjoy is alone enjoyable.</p>

<hr />

<p>Be select in your friends, but miscellaneous in your
acquaintances. Ask not sympathy from the latter nor
assistance from the former.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you would keep friends, shun explanations.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you doubt the persistence in adversity of what is
called friendship, make friends with an impecunious debtor.</p>

<p><!--241.png--><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 237</span>
Men admire women who try to please them; women
admire men who, they believe, have qualities worthy of
admiration.</p>

<hr />

<p>We like those who can be useful to us, and love those to
whom we can be useful.</p>

<hr />

<p>The secret of gaining friends is to cultivate within
ourselves the capacity for friendship.</p>

<hr />

<p>New acquaintances cannot take the place of old friends;
but when your teeth wear out, an artificial denture is a
vast advantage over bare gums.</p>

<hr />

<p>Be sure that the man who boasts of a hundred friends,
has none.</p>

<p class="p2">“It is not good that the man should be alone.”
Venerable maxim! First reflection of the Creator on
the species! Standing condemnation of all schemes of
celibacy, of all orders of monks and nuns, vestals and
spiritual eunuchs!</p>

<p>The character of any man or woman who leads the
single life is incomplete, lacking in fullness of sympathy
for certain aspects of our common nature, not perfectly
rounded to the orb of man’s whole life. All examples,
even the highest, give evidence of this. No man who has
not had a wife whom he loved can understand what love
is; he who is not a parent, can never appreciate the feelings
of a father.</p>

<p>The fruition of life, even on the lowest terms, is impossible
without the union of the sexes. The first Napoleon,
in one of his letters, describing the essential needs of man,
numbered them as three,&mdash;food, shelter, woman. All
doctrines and social theories which conflict with this
primordial law of the life of the species are unnatural, and
their tendency is lowering to the progress of the race.
Maternity, not virginity, is the holier state. Celibate
<!--243.png--><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 239</span>
orders have proved as sterile in intellectual as in physical
offspring.</p>

<p>Love, marriage, children, the family,&mdash;the emotions and
feelings, the affections and the ideas, which centre around
these foci of human activity are essential elements in every
life which is lived to the full measure of its powers. Nothing
can take their places. Happiness without them is not
human.</p>

<p>The emotion of Love belongs to those whose aims are
ideal, because it is concerned with the future evolution of
the species. In the iridescent glow of this master-passion
its object never seems a mere human being, a man or a
woman, but is invested with a charm unseen by the eye,
not expressed in form or color, endowed with the power of
exciting the soul to an indefinite and passionate expansion.
It is the inaudible appeal of unborn posterity for its share
in the world of Being.</p>

<p>Hence it is that Love is so powerfully excited by Beauty,
by the symmetry and traits which foreshadow the final
physical perfection of the race, the unconscious but unceasing
struggle of organic nature toward nobler transformations,
toward the building of a tabernacle fit to be a shrine
for the activities of a higher life.</p>

<p>Though hundreds of volumes have been written in poetry
and prose on the subject of Love, it remains unexhausted,
because it is inexhaustible. Its seed-field is the boundless
future, its message concerns all posterity. There is something
in it deeper than the emotion of any single heart,
<!--244.png--><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 240</span>
farther reaching than any individual effort. There is a secret
about it which can never be wholly told, which it were a
profanation to try to express. Even between loving ones, it
is better not to talk much of it, nor too curiously to think
about it. When true and pure, it will be manifested without
words in ennobling the character and elevating its
aims and actions.</p>

<p>The attraction of woman for man is her invisible presage
of motherhood. This it is which lends the nameless charm
to the maiden and the sacred dignity to the matron.
Around her, centre all those sentiments which constitute
the Home, the family, and the parental affections. These
find their proper expression in Marriage.</p>

<p>The history of the institution of marriage is a curious
narrative. Every conceivable relation of the sexes has
been established by one community or another, and sanctioned
by the moral sense of the time and place. There
have been hordes where the relations have been communal
or miscellaneous; others, where a man had many wives;
others, as in Thibet to-day, where the woman would have
many husbands; sometimes the woman selects the man, at
others the man the woman, and elsewhere the marriage is
arranged by third parties; in some, marriage is indissoluble,
in others, more or less easily annulled; while in certain
religious societies in our own country the method of selective
and temporary unions has been practiced. The result
of all these experiments has been to show that the happiness
of both parties is best consulted by strictly monogamous or
<!--245.png--><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 241</span>
pairing marriages, where each exerts a certain amount but
not entire freedom of selection, and where the lien can be
canceled when it proves clearly detrimental to the felicity
of either.</p>

<p>Very few words will be necessary to defend the first of
these three conditions. Under whatever form we find
polygamy, whether legalized, as in Mohammedan countries,
or sanctioned by religion, as among the Mormons, or
winked at by usage, as in mistress-keeping, it inevitably
results in the degradation of the woman and her subjection
to the dominion of lower impulses. To every one who
believes that her happiness demands equal attention to that
of the man, all schemes of polygamy stand condemned.</p>

<p>The second condition I have stated will need more
defense. Especially in our country is it unpopular to
oppose the course of love. “Let me not,” exclaims the
great dramatist, “to the marriage of true minds admit
impediment.” Yet all will admit certain impediments.
The laws of many States prohibit the marriage of near of
kin, of first cousins, and of uncles with nieces, although
in Germany unions of the latter class are very common.</p>

<p>Immature age does legally, and should always, act as a
bar to marriage. At what period of life marriage is likely
to prove most happy is a curious question, which has never
been properly studied. The physiologist, basing his opinion
on grounds of his science, would say that the woman
should be between twenty and thirty, and the man between
twenty-five and thirty-five. Dr. Johnson, regarding the
<!--246.png--><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 242</span>
question from another point of view, made the wise observation,&mdash;“Those
who marry late are best pleased with their
children, and those who marry early with their partners.”</p>

<p>Apart from questions of immature age and near relationship,
marriages in the United States are generally
contracted without restriction. The young of both sexes
are usually conceded full liberty to make their own selection,
the burden of the support of both being generally
assumed by the husband. The consequence is that such
unions are frequently entered upon with slight real
acquaintance of each other, the wife is wholly dependent,
and the husband has a heavy load to carry,&mdash;conditions
calculated to intensify the struggle for existence and
diminish the happiness of home.</p>

<p>From considerable observation of family life in both
countries, I believe that the French system is superior to
ours. In a French family of the middle or upper classes,
the parent who desires to marry a daughter, for instance,
takes pains to introduce and recommend young men of
suitable station. No coercion is used on either side. Only
when an affection naturally springs up is the union decided
upon. A marriage-settlement is drawn by which each of
the young couple receives a certain amount of property,
wholly independent of the control of the other. Thus
they are freed from the severest pressure of monetary
anxiety, and, what is especially valuable, the wife has a
recognized place of power, and secures her rightful prestige
in the family circle. I have often observed how superior
<!--247.png--><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 243</span>
is the position of the wife in France to what it is in this
country. The reason is in the better method of forming
marriages.</p>

<p>A sympathetic marriage is the happiest condition of
human life; but one without sympathy is a hateful servitude.
How distressing to be obliged to live <em>for</em> those whom we
cannot bear to live <em>with</em>!</p>

<p>The number of unhappy marriages in the United States
may be guessed from the records of the divorce courts,
which register only some of the most unhappy. The
divorces granted annually sever nearly thirty thousand
couples, and this although in many States such separation
is costly, slow, and difficult. These figures represent, therefore,
but a small fraction of the marriages which are galling
the backs of one or both of the parties concerned.</p>

<p>When we reflect what the true foundations of the marital
relations should be,&mdash;love, affection, sympathy,&mdash;it would
appear wholly foreign to its character that it should be
made an obligatory fetter and a continued curse by any
law, civil or religious. The moral sense, personal affection,
parental feeling, and the sentiment of society, would seem
to be sufficient to preserve all those unions which should be
preserved. Their severance should be left to the option
of the parties concerned alone. Surely the happiness of
the individual would be better consulted by such an
arrangement than by that which now prevails.</p>

<p>Marriages, so far from being entered upon with greater
recklessness, would then be more cautiously undertaken,
<!--248.png--><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 244</span>
because their durability would depend on mutual satisfaction.
The woman would have full equality of rights, and
not be a miserable sacrifice to unjust laws, as now she often
is. It would be a step toward the ideal of the marriage
state, which is a union based on love, in which each party
has absolutely equal rights and stands pledged to equal
duties, and neither is bound to the other longer than love
and duty are respected. Neither government nor religion
should put obstacles in the way of the dissolution of marriage
other than those safeguards of the interests involved,
which attend the termination of all important contracts.</p>

<p>Deep thinkers on the relations of life in goodly number
have long advocated these views. They have been those
of John Milton, of William von Humboldt, of John
Stuart Mill. Nor is there anything in them which an
enlightened moral or religious sentiment should oppose;
rather the contrary. As Milton so well says in his Treatise
on Divorce,&mdash;“Where Love cannot be, there can be left
of wedlock nothing but the empty husk of an outside
matrimony, as undelightful and unpleasing to God as any
other kind of hypocrisy.”</p>

<p>The object of marriage is the Family. Love claims
immortality through posterity. The hidden though ever-present
purpose of the union of the sexes is the perpetuation
and evolution of the species. Any union which avoids
this object is destructive, and not creative of true happiness.
We are told of the ancient ascetic sect of the
Essenes that the sexes united in marriage, but remained
<!--249.png--><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 245</span>
chaste; and had families of children, but gathered them
from among the foundlings and homeless orphans of the
highways. Their impossible example does not merit the
praise, as it has not enlisted the imitation of, later generations.
The maternal and paternal affections, the love of
family and the pleasures derived from the ties of kindred,
are enjoyments which the properly constituted individual
will never be willing to sacrifice unless constrained thereto
by mighty and exceptional conditions. The tacit assumption
of mutual aid and confidence between brothers and
sisters, and the intimacy which is fostered by even remoter
degrees of relationship, are beneficent elements of the
social compact, and contribute largely to the happiness of
the individual.</p>

<p>The Family, as we understand it, is distinctly a product
of high civilization. In savage tribes the ties of consanguinity
are quite different. In many, for instance, the
father is scarcely regarded as a relation, blood kin being
counted through the mother only. The rise of the
paternal or patriarchial form of the family appears at a
higher stage of culture; and when, as among the Etruscans
and Romans, it was coincident with a recognized equality
in marriage, society advanced with rapid strides.</p>

<p>Some believe that the theory of the family, as it has so
long prevailed in Europe, is inappropriate for this country,
and hence that it is disappearing among us, as unsuited to
the development of our forms of culture. Children desire
their liberty earlier, and parents are ready to comply with
<!--250.png--><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 246</span>
their requests. No ties other than material ones are
recognized as constituting a family unit. It will be for
the future to decide whether the greater personal independence
thus secured has been of more value to the
happiness of the race than the elements of affection sacrificed
in obtaining it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Law is the bond of the state, love, of the family. The
former rules best by precept, the latter by example.</p>

<p>Those marriages are ominous which transmit miseries.</p>

<p>The family tie differs from the tie of friendship in that
it binds together interests rather than sympathies.</p>

you for it, fated, foolish friend.</p>

<p>A man weeps for the lost loved one; a woman for the
lost love.</p>

<hr />

<p>Love is the language in which the gods speak to man,
observes Plato. Unfortunate is he who hears it not;
doubly unfortunate he who hears, but comprehends it not.</p>

<hr />

<p>True love is love of love; not love of the pleasures of love.</p>

<p class="center muchlarger">The Consolations of Affliction.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <span class="title">The Removal of Unhappiness.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">Suffer we must. No position is exempt, no foresight
can avoid it. Neither the self-abnegation of asceticism nor
the visions of superstition relieve from that law. The
latter do but deceive and the former atrophies the soul.
Far better to seek in the strength of our own minds and
in the helpful sympathy of others those sources of Consolation
which will enable us to bear pain and grief and
disappointment, without allowing them to pass into ennui,
gloom, and the distaste for life. Calm reflection, clear
reasoning, and the soothing kindness of those who love us,
will prepare us to meet and bear the evils of life, without
having recourse to the illusions of credulity or the aridities
of stoicism.</p>

<p>The mind can be trained to forecast the probable good
and ill of its career, and thus prepare itself for even the
worst of fates, without being plunged into the hopelessness
of despair. We can learn to suffer, and to find even suffering
<!--253.png--><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 249</span>
good. To a trained mind, no deprivation is an
absolute misfortune.</p>

<p>What is more, this very training is the best of preservatives
as well as the best of alleviatives; for by it we are
prompted and enabled to take wise measures to avoid those
evils which our forethought brings to our mind.</p>

<p>Consolation we all need, all must have, all should give, if
we would develop the sweeter and nobler elements of our
natures. He who through mistaken pride or stubborn distrust
refuses to seek it, does but dwarf his powers and darken
his perceptions to the beauties of the world around him.
To impart and to receive the solace of sympathetic words
and kindly offices belong to the highest ministrations of
friendship and love and charity. Those characters in
history around whose faces shines brightest the aureole of
glory have been those who have soothed the sorrows and
bound up the wounds of the despairing sons of men.</p>

<p>Fortunately, if evils are many, so are the sources of consolation.
We may seek them in ourselves, from others, or
from a correct comprehension of the laws of nature; and
when these prove inadequate, we may still win the victory,
by discovering that Sorrow itself is not an enemy but a
friend, a veiled and ghostly guide, who leads us, as the
spirit of Virgil led Dante, and as only Sorrow can lead,
through the realms of gloom and woe to undreamed-of fields
of serenity and light.</p>

<p>Only in hint and outline shall I sketch this part of my
plan. It is too vast to attempt more. Some of the reflections
<!--254.png--><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 250</span>
which in the sadder hours of my own life I have found
of avail I shall present in detached fragments; for the spirit
in the shadow needs but a single ray to illume its path.
The moods of sorrow are many, and one suggestion may
soothe where a score of others find no application. What
I offer are suggestions only, to be expanded by the reader
as he finds one or another of them suitable to his own case.</p>

<hr />

<p>Two very consoling reflections are: First, how much of
the unhappiness of life springs from preventable causes, and
next, how little of it arises from actual evils. When we
deliberately investigate, catalogue, and analyze what we
ourselves and our neighbors are distressed about, we are
inclined to say that the chief aim of human effort is not
happiness, but rather that each shall make himself as
unhappy as possible.</p>

<p>Look at the list! Desires and aims which are plainly
inconsistent and contradictory with each other; hopes
which reason clearly shows are doomed to disappointment,
because they are unfounded or exaggerated; anxieties which
are visibly causeless or useless; mistaken estimates of our
own powers, which honest reflection would correct; envy
of the supposed better fortune of others, when often they
are more unhappy than ourselves; fears for a future which
we may never reach; regret for a past which we can never
recall; open-eyed abuse or neglect of opportunities;
indulgence in passions or appetites which we know to be
<!--255.png--><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 251</span>
harmful; needless risk or sacrifice of health or liberty or
money.</p>

<p>Think of how much of your unhappiness has arisen from
one or other of these causes, and then take comfort in the
thought how much it lies in your power to be far happier
than you are.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is an advantage in the multiplicity of miseries.
One deep vexation is often more fatal to happiness than
several. It becomes a fixed idea, monopolizes the mind,
and is more dangerous to its health, than when one is
obliged “to take up arms against a sea of troubles.” Regret
not, therefore, when clouds darken all the horizon;
better this, than the single sky-specter, in whose bosom is
the whirlwind, and on whose path follows destruction.</p>

<hr />

<p>When little matters annoy you, remember that it is a
proof that your condition is a peculiarly happy one.
Great sorrows leave no room for slight irritations. The
man on the rack does not feel the prick of a pin.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tears are the medicinal waters provided by nature for
healing the sickened spirit. They are the stream which
by its overflowing renews the fertility of the wastes left arid
by woe. But, like these greater streams, their excess brings
devastation.</p>

<hr />

<p><!--256.png--><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 252</span>
Unhappiness is sometimes only a bad habit. Weeping
eyes are quick to tears, and grief is a guest that stays on
slight urging.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ill-fortune and plenty of it is the very stimulus some
natures need to bring out the best that is in them. There
is a dead weight about them, and bad luck is the only lever
that will lift it. Without its prod, they would sink into
lethargy and become like Chaucer’s</p>

<hr />

<p>There are two inconsistencies of grief which surpass all
others: the one, when it leads us to regret that which we
might have enjoyed, long after the time when we could
have enjoyed it is past; the other, when it makes us the
sadder to-day, because we enjoyed ourselves yesterday.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is something humorous in the two most popular
methods of consolation. The one is, to show you how
much worse off you might have been; the other, to remind
you how much more wretched others are.</p>

<p>When I was a boy, I was consoled for cutting my finger
by having my attention called to the fact that I had not
broken my arm; and when I got a cinder in my eye, I was
expected to feel more comfortable because my cousin had
lost his by an accident.</p>

<p><!--257.png--><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 253</span>
The general opinion evidently is that the most agreeable
consolation in sorrow is a contemplation of the greater
misery of others; and the real ground of happiness is to
know that others are suffering.</p>

<hr />

<p>When a man in adversity complains of the demeanor
of others toward him, inquire of his actions toward them.</p>

<hr />

<p>Talk it over. “Pull not your hat about your brows.”
Seek a sympathetic companion and pour your sorrows into
his kindly ears; not so much for the consolation he may
administer, but because sad emotions assume their right
proportions only when shown to others. In the darkened
room of the mind they loom up like giants, when in the
light they may prove to be pigmies. But hide your
sorrows from the general gaze; sometimes the effort will
conceal them from your own.</p>

<hr />

<p>If we would only see it, there is a humorous side to
nearly every occurrence; and if we did see it, what a
preservative from despondency it would be!</p>

<hr />

<p>Whatever happiness we get, we believe it is our own by
right; when we miss that which we expected, we consider
ourselves robbed. What impertinence! Does any one
really pretend that because he wants something he is therefore
<!--258.png--><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 254</span>
entitled to it? Because he covets my house has he a
fee in it? Suppose we give up for a while coveting and
wanting, and settle down to doing and thinking and
bearing. Perhaps that is the best way out, after all.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you have no passions that you cannot conquer, you
will have no griefs that you cannot bear.</p>

<hr />

<p>The human body has a surprising ability to adapt its
functions to the presence of permanent injuries and chronic
maladies. Physicians call this the “tolerance of disease.”
The healthy mind has a similar power to recover its cheerfulness
in the presence of an abiding grief or after an
irreparable loss.</p>

<hr />

<p>Indolence and Timidity are the jailers who rivet the
fetters of Despondency. Courage and Activity will deliver
us if we choose to summon them.</p>

<hr />

<p>As the scars of battle are, in the opinion of the pious,
proofs of the protection of Heaven, so a keen sense of
past calamities testifies to a capacity for future enjoyment.</p>

<hr />

<p>Between the leaves of the Book of Life why not press
the violets, the lilies, and the roses which we find on our
path, rather than the nettles and bitter weeds? We could
<!--259.png--><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 255</span>
then turn back its pages with satisfaction, and live again
long-since-vanished joys.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are few more accurate standards of a man’s education,
in the widest sense of the term, than the quality of
the consolation he offers.</p>

<hr />

<p>Would you learn the Universal Catholicon, the Balm for
all wounds, the Panacea for all sorrows? I will whisper it:
Work&mdash;hard physical work, arduous mental work. Try it;
it will dry your tears, renew your love of life, recall the
light of hope, and exorcise the evil spirits.</p>

<hr />

<p>Strengthen the Will. If you have any earnest business
in life, and are bound to carry it through, you will have
no time for moping. If you have none, find some.</p>

<hr />

<p>Look before and after. Do not allow the present to
cheat you. The impression of the moment always claims
more than it deserves, because we have not time to modify
it by other thoughts and images. A present danger
frightens us, though we may know it is infinitesimally
small; a parting brings tears, though we are aware it is for
the good of all; offensive words hurt us, though they may
proceed from a contemptible person. Hasten to evoke
<!--260.png--><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 256</span>
memories and summon hopes which will beautify the
incident, and strengthen the mind. Remember the slightness
of the peril, speak of the happy return, recall the
praise you have received from worthy lips.</p>

<hr />

<p>The honey of life can be had only at the expense of
some stings in its collection.</p>

<hr />

<p>Whatever happens, take it as a matter of course. You
are not running the world, nor born to set it right. You
are not half so much the master of your own actions as you
think you are.</p>

<hr />

<p>Deal justly by yourself. Few do. They regret making
that decision, or performing the other action, or neglecting
such or such an opportunity. They reproach themselves
for their hastiness or carelessness.</p>

<p>What folly! far worse results might have attended a
different course. We can see but a very little way in life,
and that very darkly. We can neither forecast events, nor
predict our own decisions in new circumstances.</p>

<p>If we act at the time with reasonable prudence, we need
never waste later moments in self-reproach. Any other
decision than the one we adopted would likely enough
have brought still more dismal consequences.</p>

<hr />

<p><!--261.png--><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 257</span>
Remember that you are never deserted by all until you
have deserted yourself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Do not confound a decision with its results. The
former may have been at the time the wisest possible,
although the latter were disastrous.</p>

<hr />

<p>What you consider a life-long mistake, your biographer
may regard as the most fortunate decision of your life.</p>

<hr />

<p>Grief lies in ambush. Its attack is like the spring of a
lion. Its onset is the crisis that calls for the most heroic
resistance. Despair seizes its victim in the first moments
of a great sorrow.</p>

<hr />

<p>Life is like a game of whist. Luck deals the cards, but
we have the lead. We may receive a poor hand, but by
playing it carefully win the odd.</p>

<hr />

<p>Physical pain is an excellent antidote for mental pain.
The hair shirt and the scourge were positive pleasures to
the ascetic, because they distracted his thoughts from hell-fire.</p>

<hr />

<p>The incivility of others is a frequent source of keen pain
to sensitive dispositions. Socrates’ advice was to look on
<!--262.png--><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 258</span>
an impolite person as on one deformed or repulsive in
appearance; to be borne with when necessary, and fit to
excite our pity rather than our anger. When some one
asked Descartes how he met discourtesies he replied, “I
try to live so high that they cannot reach me.” The impoliteness
of small children does not hurt our feelings;
we should look on the uncivil generally with the same
consciousness of our own superiority.</p>

<hr />

<p>Grieve not at the ingratitude of others, even of your
children. Much that looks like ingratitude is only forgetfulness.
Again, what you think is a favor conferred, others
may regard as a right respected. To some minds a sense
of obligations received is really painful, and their ungrateful
demeanor is an effort to escape this feeling. Perhaps
you conferred the favor in a manner to induce such a
feeling. When ingratitude pains you, overhaul your books
and see if you find any debt of gratitude unpaid.</p>

<hr />

<p>Do you seek consolation for the loss of a loved one?
Call to mind, not the pleasant hours you passed together,
but the kind actions, the proofs of affection, you received
from him. Thus his personality will be idealized, and will
become a sweet memory instead of a bitter regret.</p>

<hr />

<p>I have repeatedly noticed, in my own life and in others,
that the failure of a plan led to a success in another direction
<!--263.png--><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 259</span>
far greater than that anticipated from the original
project. Two of the most eminent surgeons in the United
States became physicians only in consequence of early
failures in small business. When misfortunes happen,
therefore, they may be paving the way for great successes.
Our failure may be due to our superiority. Milton failed
as a teacher of small boys, and Dr. Marion Sims as keeper
of a country store. The Chipeways have a story of a man
who could do no work, because he was so strong that he
broke every tool he took up.</p>

<hr />

<p>Are you vexed by some persistent anxiety, haunted by
some ugly thought? Learn the secret, that the only way
to stop thinking of anything is to think of something else.
You cannot banish care by an effort of the will; but you
can drive it away by changing the associations of your
ideas, by engaging in some occupation which demands
your constant and close attention.</p>

<hr />

<p>Always keep in mind the uselessness of contending with
the inflexible and inevitable processes of nature; but never
let them become your masters when you can make them
your servants.</p>

<hr />

<p>Resignation is the more of a virtue the less it is exercised.
A healthy tree bends before the blast, but straightens
itself the moment the wind lulls. Resignation to evils
that can be avoided is indolence or apathy.</p>

<hr />

<p><!--264.png--><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 260</span>
When the world seems a desert to you and life a blank,
reflect whether you have not had just such feelings before,
and overlived them to enjoy happy days and smiling
seasons.</p>

<hr />

<p>Seek sympathy for your losses from a woman, for your
failures from a man. A woman will not understand why
you tried, if you failed.</p>

<hr />

<p>Half of happiness is the recognition that we are happy;
and half of misery is the forgetting how many causes of
happiness we have.</p>

<hr />

<p>Be sure you are more doleful than you need be. There
is no liar like low spirits. Melancholy is a sort of mental
stagnation; and stagnant pools are soon filled with foul
growths.</p>

<hr />

<p>You there, you on the verge of despair, sit down, take a
pen, and write me off a list of your sorrows and misfortunes;
and follow it with a faithful inventory of what you
have left on the side of possible happiness, your faculties,
your possessions, your friends and relatives, your acquirements,
your tastes, your healthful activities, your probability
of life, your reasonable expectations, not forgetting
your duties to others and the gratification their fulfillment
will give. Then I am ready to adjust the account.</p>

<hr />

<p><!--265.png--><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 261</span>
Plato says that nothing in human life is worth much
trouble; certainly many things give us more trouble than
they are worth.</p>

<hr />

<p>How small is your grief if you measure it by the
standards of the universe! Look up at the calm and
silent stars; they are billions of miles away. Notice that
piece of sandstone; fifty million years have passed since
the primeval tide washed its grains together. Is there not
something in such thoughts that makes you a little ashamed
of the preoccupation of your mind with its petty present
cares?</p>

<hr />

<p>Do you reflect sometimes that you are but one of fifteen
hundred millions of human beings, fifty millions of whom
die every year? Is it worth while passing your invisibly
small share of life in worrying about trifles?</p>

<hr />

<p>The only malady all covet is the only one which is absolutely
fatal,&mdash;old age.</p>

<hr />

<p>Death is the most and the least feared of any event.
Seven of my most intimate friends committed suicide for
various reasons, all good enough in their opinions. “No
passion is so weak,” remarks Bacon, “but that a little
pushed it will master the fear of death.”</p>

<hr />

<p><!--266.png--><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 262</span>
The visits of death seem always inopportune. Dickens
tells of a visit he paid to an Old Man’s Home. He found
that, in the opinion of the inmates, every old man died
prematurely. They invariably said, “He brought it on
hisself.”</p>

<hr />

<p>He who is haunted by the dread of dying makes himself
miserable for fear he cannot make himself miserable
longer.</p>

<hr />

<p>When death is natural, that is, in extreme old age, it is
neither feared nor felt. That it is so little a thing when
natural, suggests that at all times we may deem it too great.</p>

<hr />

<p>If we understood Death, we should no longer care for
Life.</p>

<h3 class="h3head"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <span class="title">The Inseparable Connection of Pleasure and
Pain.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">The hard and strange lesson that I would teach in this
chapter is, that dreams of unalloyed bliss are not merely
fanciful, they are impossible of realization under any known
conditions of life; that pleasure requires pain, joy demands
sorrow, as the very condition of its existence; and that
these pairs are inseparable twins, the presence of one being
bound up in that of the other.</p>

<p>I here promulgate no new discovery in the science of
mind, though it has been much overlooked by physiologists,
and quite put one side by sanguine optimists in their
rosy paintings of the future perfectibility and universal
happiness of the human race. More than two thousand
years ago Socrates dwelt upon this same uncanny blending
of contraries. The jailer, as we are told in the “Phædo,”
of Plato, removed the galling iron fetters from the philosopher’s
ankles shortly before the cup of hemlock was handed
him; and in this brief interval his friends gathered around
him for the last farewell.</p>

<p>     “And Socrates, sitting on the side of the bed, bent
his leg and rubbed it with his hand, and in doing so said,&mdash;'How
strange a thing, my friends, is that which is called
<!--268.png--><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 264</span>
Pleasure! and how oddly it is connected with what is
called Pain! Pleasure and Pain do not come to man
together; but if a person runs after the one and catches it,
he almost immediately catches the other too, as if they
were fastened together at one end. I think if Æsop had
noticed this he would have compiled a fable to this effect:
That the gods tried to reconcile these two opposites, and
not being able to do this, fastened their extremities together
so that when you take hold of one it pulls after it the other.
And so it happens to me now; there was pain in my leg
when the chain bound it, and now comes pleasure following
the pain.’”</p>

<p>A law of physiology, a law of the whole universe, underlies
these homely reflections of the ancient Greek.</p>

<p>On the one side, pleasure and pain are states of feeling
totally opposed to each other both in sensation and in physical
effect, pleasure being concomitant with an increase,
pain with a decrease, of the vital functions; and yet, on
the other, there is a unity, or, at any rate, a close analogy
of action, under these contrary conditions of mental
life. Each is a stimulus to new forms of mental change and
biotic motion, though in the one instance the tendency of
the new activity is toward a higher concentration of the individual
life, and, in the other, toward its diminution or its
disaggregation into other and lower forms.</p>

<p>A feeling of pleasure is an exaltation of sensation in some
special set of nerves. These are stimulated to an unwonted
exercise of their functions; but they can provide this disproportionate
<!--269.png--><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 265</span>
energy only by drafts on the general resources
of the nervous system; and this must be paid back through
exhaustion, fatigue, or, perhaps, actual pain.</p>

<p>A sensation of pain also demands for its presence special
and unusual conditions of nervous activity, which also
result in exhaustion of the powers of sensation, but, unfortunately,
much later than in conditions of pleasure. Pain
seems in some sort more our natural element, for we can
bear it much longer than pleasure in equal degree. Generalizing
on this fact, Schopenhauer reached the dismal
conclusion&mdash;“The essential elements of all Life are pain
and sorrow.”</p>

<p>The mere cessation of pain is in itself a pleasure of considerable
degree, as in the case of Socrates relieved from
the chafing of his irons; indeed, probably some of the
intensest moments of delight are those experienced on a
sudden relief from acute suffering, or during the reaction
from long privations.</p>

<p>It may not be quite correct to say that all pleasurable
sensations are immediately derived from or directly
lead to others of a painful character. There are some belonging
to the organic life, such as the satisfaction of the
desire for food or for muscular exercise, in which mere
repose or remission is enough to repay the nervous drafts.
But how close these are to pain is visible from the acuteness
of the pangs of hunger, or the painfulness of prolonged
positions of restraint.</p>

<p>Even exalted esthetic and intellectual pleasures, which
<!--270.png--><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 266</span>
seem to leave no sting behind and to require no goad for
their advance, constantly make unfelt though heavy drafts
on the nervous centres, the results of which, under the
various forms of cerebral and spinal exhaustion and degeneration,
physicians are obliged to take cognizance of only
too often.</p>

<p>So close is the analogy between the two antagonistic
sensations, that the one becomes merged into the other
without our being able to mark the dividing line between
them. A moderate pain may by its active diffusion actually
bring a surplus of pleasure, as Professor Bain has remarked;
and that an acute sensation of pleasure may pass
into one of pain is matter of common observation. Thus,
Pain is born of Pleasure, Pleasure of Pain; and memory
and association have a tendency to diminish the extremes
of each by recalling to the mind the sources from which it
sprang. Some physiologists, therefore, refuse to discriminate
between such inseparable feelings, and prefer to regard
them both as manifestations of the same, calling it
the “Pleasure-Pain sensation.”</p>

<p>In all these respects what is true of these sensations also
holds good of their analogues in the realm of emotions, as
joy and sorrow, mirth and sadness, hope and fear, and the
like. Each of these exercises, and by exercising exhausts,
some fibres of the nervous system, and thus tends to develop
its contrary.</p>

<p>The general law which, as far as it goes, explains these
facts is that of the alternation or periodicity of the manifestations
<!--271.png--><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 267</span>
of force. This is the fundamental law of the
Universe, beyond which no analysis has proceeded. Force,
or Power, or Energy, wherever we discern it and under
every one of its exhibitions, expresses itself in undulatory
or rhythmical movements, pulsations of the primal potency,
vibrations of the central harmony, of the universe. In the
rise and fall of sensation and emotion the sequences of
height and depth are as closely related as are the proportions
of the crest and trough in the waves of the ocean, or
those of the vibration of the strings of a musical instrument.</p>

<p>Such considerations as these, drawn from the unalterable
laws of nature and life, show how short is the sight of those
who look upon happiness as the uninterrupted continuance
of pleasurable sensations, or would seek it in a ceaseless
round of gayety. Far clearer was the vision of Pindar
when he exclaimed, with the inspiration of a poet,&mdash;“Beneath
every true pleasure hides the sense of a past pain.”
The dark background of sorrow can alone give full relief
to the bright figure of joy. Grief is a part of gladness,
and that life is not happy which has no unhappiness. So
Browning, with characteristic insight and strength, puts in
the mouth of one of his intensest characters,&mdash;“Naught is
lacking to complete our bliss, but woe.”</p>

<p>These are not mere paradoxes and literary refinements
on scientific facts. All who have entered sympathetically
into the deep and tender emotions of the human heart
have felt and seen this mysterious and inseparable connection.

It is so beautifully set forth in reference to one of
the saddest griefs of life by Leigh Hunt, that I must quote
his words. They are in his essay on the “Deaths of Little
Children.”</p>

<p>     “Pain softens into pleasure as the darker hue of the
rainbow melts into the brighter.… Made as we
are, there are certain pains without which it would be difficult
to conceive certain great and overbalancing pleasures.
We may conceive it possible for beings to be made entirely
happy; but in our composition, something of pain seems
to be a necessary ingredient in order that the materials
may turn to as fine an account as possible. The loss of
children seems to be one of those necessary bitters thrown
into the cup of humanity. If none at all ever took place,
we should regard every little child as a man or a woman
secured; and it will easily be conceived what a world of
endearing cares and hopes this security would endanger.
The very idea of infancy would lose continuity with us.
Girls and boys would be future men and women, not present
children. They would have attained their full growth
in our imaginations, and might as well have been men and
women at once. On the other hand, those who have lost
an infant are never, as it were, without an infant child.
They are the only persons who, in one sense, retain it
always; and they furnish their neighbors with the same
idea. The other children grow up to manhood or to
womanhood and suffer all the changes of mortality. This
one alone is rendered an immortal child. Death has
<!--273.png--><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 269</span>
arrested it with his kindly harshness, and blessed it into an
eternal image of youth and innocence.</p>

<p>     “Of such as these are the pleasantest shapes that visit
our fancy and our hopes; they are the ever-smiling
emblems of joy; the prettiest pages that wait upon imagination;
lastly, 'Of these are the Kingdom of Heaven.’”</p>

<p>Something akin to the sweetness of these touching reflections
is found in Sir Richard Steele’s essay on “The
Death of Friends,” whose stately and gracious style seems
ever treading a minuet at the court of good Queen
Anne:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>     “When we are advanced in years, there is not a more
pleasing entertainment than to recollect the many we have
parted with that have been dear to us.… It is necessary
to revive the old places of grief in our memory, to
lead the mind unto that sobriety of thought which poises
the heart and makes it beat with due time, without being
quickened by desire or retarded by despair from its proper
and equal motion.”</p>

<p>Thus it is that sadness is ofttimes a necessary and the best
preparative for gladness. The blacker the shadow, the
brighter is the light that casts it. In all pleasurable feelings
there must be the alternations from exercise to remission
and repose; and in proportion as such feelings are keen,
will pain take the place of simple exhaustion. When the
waves of emotion are but ripples on the surface of life,
stirred by the zephyrs of light desires, the remission will
be but a passing sense of fatigue; but when the sensitive
<!--274.png--><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 270</span>
heart is shaken to its depths by the mighty winds of passion,
then the reaction will be not less profound, and the
moments of wild joy will be repaid to the uttermost by
periods of dejection and despair. In such temperaments
there is danger of the morbid persistence of the period of
depression, and ready recourse must be had to diversion
and occupation to avoid this considerable peril.</p>

<p>There is a singular but comforting contrast in the influence
of time on pleasure and pain and the mental states
which correspond to them.</p>

<p>Through repetition and habitual exercise we may become
passionately fond of what at first was painful or disgusting.
Witness the use of tobacco and all other so-called
“acquired tastes.” The physician becomes enamored of
the studies of the hospital ward and the dissecting room;
persons who are at first sight repulsive become tolerable
and then companionable; studies which we take up with
dislike later on fascinate us.</p>

<p>How different with pleasures! Their tendency is not
upward but downward, gravitating ever toward the lower
and painful strata of sensation. Those built on a foundation
of previous pain alone escape a merely evanescent
existence. How quickly facile loves are sated! Ennui
arrives never earlier than when enjoyment is gratuitous.
The law, alas, holds good even for our dearest joys; as
Mrs. Browning wrote:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

Time, transmuter of all things, turns delight into disgust,
and aversion into love, but his metamorphoses constantly
warn us that permanence is related to painfulness
and duration depends on endurance.</p>

<hr />

<p>Pain is more natural to us than pleasure. We bear it
better. Bad fortune is easier sustained than good. The
hour of prosperity is more trying than that of adversity.
These are commonplaces, and speak for the universal
recognition of this feature of mind.</p>

significance when we know it is performed for the last

Infinite, of Death and Destiny. Our souls hear the distant
dirge, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vale, vale, eternumque vale</i>.</p>

<p>We can always explain our merriment, but often not our
melancholy. Glee is concrete and affirmative; dejection
is vague and negative; and the negative is unlimited.</p>

<hr />

<p>The drama of life is a tragedy, for its last scene is always
that of the death of the title-role. We take the greatest
interest in the spectacle, but rarely care to remember the
denouement.</p>

<p>If you love life so much, why complain of ennui?
There is nothing like it for lengthening the hours, and
thus giving you longer to live.</p>

<p>The more pleasant the moments, the swifter they fly.
Perfect happiness would destroy Time.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <span class="title">The Education of Suffering.</span></h3>

<p class="p2">What is suffering? What is sorrow?</p>

<p>Nought but the wounds in our conflict with the imperfections
and limitations of life, with the elements of death
and annihilation, with the powers of falsehood and hatred.
The inappeasable thirst in the human heart for the fullness
of existence, for complete happiness, could only be satisfied
with all love and all truth, and we should need the term
of all time in which to attain them.</p>

<p>Pain and grief are, therefore, evident proofs of the
capacity for broader conditions of being; and at the same
time they are the guides, pointing out what to avoid and
what to seek, in order to attain this end of all desire.</p>

<p>This is true of all organic existence; but man alone is
capable of Sorrow, a passion allied to the most exalted
moods of mind, presenting to it the image of infinity,
defining and educating his desires by the clear exhibition
of their painful limitations, and thus revealing to his perceptions
new though arduous paths, which will lead him to
a loftier evolution and broader horizons.</p>

<p>He finds that sorrow is an initiation into the hidden
mysteries of life. Through its draped portals he enters
the Temple of Sadness, there to learn “the elder truths,
<!--278.png--><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 274</span>
and the secrets that cannot be spoken.” He must be
bathed in the fountain of tears and be branded with the
blade of adversity before he is established in the novitiate
of the order of Our Mother of Sorrows.</p>

<p>Once admitted to her chosen band, he looks back
without regret at his earlier and placid joys. His sorrow
lives on within him as a new and indestructible force of
character, expressing itself in added strength of will,
clearness of perception, and breadth of sympathies. It
has imparted to life another meaning, one more male and
heroic, and yet tender, such as no pleasures can suggest or
beget. The years may be paler, their flowers fewer, their
grave-mounds more numerously strewn across his pathway;
over them he steps with steady tread, his eye fixed on the
work which he has learned is for him to do, asking neither
about its rewards nor its results.</p>

<p>This is the spirit of those teachers and lovers of their
kind, who have taken as their own the sorrows of the race;
it is the spirit of those martyrs to liberty who have fallen
to free their country from the yoke of tyrants; and of
those sufferers for truth’s sake who have been tortured and
burned by the Churches rather than live by lying recantations.</p>

<p>History constantly proves that the worthiest prizes of
life, its loftiest virtues, and its most ennobling ambitions,
are sold only at the price of suffering. The great world-religions,
Buddhism and Christianity, began with proclaiming
this final fact of life; and to its instinctive recognition
<!--279.png--><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 275</span>
by the experience of all mankind are due their conquests
over the faiths which held out the allurements of material
success and physical pleasure. The spirit of Christianity
is the spirit of sadness. To it the house of mourning is
ever better than the house of mirth. The Cross is the
symbol of suffering; the steps are blood-stained that mount
to Calvary; anguish and death are at its summit; for
suffering and death are the signs, the admonitions, and the
entrance to the Infinite.</p>

<p>Art acknowledges the same inspirations as its highest.
Sad emotions attract most potently because they arise from
the unplumbed depth of the soul, and suggest its limitless
dimensions. They attest the words of the poet, that
“Man’s grief is but his grandeur in disguise.” There is
always a strange attraction about scenes of suffering; the
appetite is always keen “to sup full of horrors;” our
emotions are more profoundly stirred by the spectacle of
pain and anguish <a name="chg7" id="chg7"></a>than by that of any imaginable pleasure.</p>

<p>Therefore the works as well as the lives of great artists
have been full of sadness. The group of the Laocoon struggling
in the deadly coil of the serpent; the agony of the crucifixion;
the tragedies of love and jealousy and devotion,&mdash;these
have been the chosen themes of painters, sculptors
and dramatists; chosen because they mark graphically the
struggles of our common nature with its limits, ennobled
by its ambition to leap beyond them.</p>

<p>Every soul knows, unconsciously and instinctively, that
sorrow is the only teacher of what is most valuable in life.
<!--280.png--><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 276</span>
It alone develops fortitude, and therefore it commands the
respect of all; it alone teaches sympathy, and therefore it
enlists the admiration of all. No character is ripe which
has not crispened under its sharp breath; none is of finest
temper but those forged by its heavy blows. The noblest
lives are sad; but those who have quaffed the severe joy of
sorrow care little for the light froth of pleasure.</p>

<p>The quality of high energy is developed only by affliction.
Wrestling with it, the sinews of the mind are trained.
We must go forth and seek new supports in life, when we
have lost those which we loved and depended upon. By
such an effort, we reconcile ourselves to the loss, gain a
victory over fate, strengthen our minds, and reach an air
of wider freedom. The blast may beat at the gate, but all
is quiet within. There is a habit of sadness which is not
gloomy, which may share and admire the delights of life,
but which is ever ready to meet the storms of misfortune
with serenity and fortitude. Such a habit of mind lifts
one above the threats and disturbances of the ceaseless
struggle for existence into the companionship of ideas and
powers which the poet rightly calls celestial:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

which need but to be recognized and cherished for the
<!--281.png--><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 277</span>
sting to be blunted, and what seems at first a grief without
an element of alleviation, to become in time the foundation
of a higher happiness. How often may one exclaim
with Cleopatra, in the midst of her <a name="chg8" id="chg8"></a>immeasurable losses:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>We need occasionally some violent and painful shock to
waken us from the lethargy of pleasant custom, to break the
shackles of agreeable and enervating habit, to tear us by
the roots from the soil in which we lazily vegetate, and
transplant us into fresh and richer fields. The beautiful
elements in a noble character are woven together by the
experience of afflictions, as the pearls which form the
design of a brooch are held in place by the thread of iron
on which they are strung.</p>

<p>The affections which are deep and pure leave behind
them when they are severed by fate a happiness which is
comparable to that of their enjoyment. Our sorrow for
such is accompanied with an inexpressible sense of consolation,
the firm and sweet assurance&mdash;“’Tis better to have
loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.”</p>

<p>This compensation flows, from the nature of affection
itself, because it is essentially unselfish, and ever seeking
objects outside the circle of egoistic instincts. It is Love
that teaches us that Joy and Sorrow are twins; and at the
same time sharply defines what are the true objects of
affection. Its sweet waters pour inexhaustible streams
of consolation for the wounds of Fate, but not for those
<!--282.png--><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 278</span>
of Fortune. For the loss of money or rank or other mere
externality it offers no such assuagement, for it deems all
such losses beneath its sovereign notice. The solace for
these must be sought in fortitude and courage and resignation.
Only of the loss of such lower means of happiness
as these is the saying of the poet true, that “A sorrow’s
crown of sorrows is remembering happier things.” Rather
let us say, the only sorrows we should not be ashamed of,
are those which turn into joy. The griefs that embitter
and harden, follow loves that are lowering.</p>

<p>Noble sorrow is the teacher of sympathy. The sense or
the memory of our own pain awakens the desire to relieve
the pain of others. Compassion and Pity are the offspring
of grief. It also teaches tolerance, charity for the imperfections
of others, and a knowledge of the limitations and
deficiencies of our common nature, without which knowledge
the successful endeavor for any of the higher aims of
existence is not possible. The sense of physical suffering
has been the guiding principle in the evolution of organic
forms from the monad up to man. His future and higher
evolution, that of his spirit-powers, will come from his
mental suffering and the lessons he will draw from it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Thus, at the end of our wide wandering in pursuit of
Happiness, we look back and see that it is absent from
nothing in life, not even from pain and sorrow; nay, that
when all else has gone, when youth and health and fortune
<!--283.png--><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 279</span>
and love have left us, when we look forward despairingly
to nought but loneliness and suffering, our very despair
may prove to be divine, “begotten by the finite upon
the infinite,” and from its depths we may draw a rapture
unknown to common pleasures, and taste the sweet waters
of a bliss which is celestial.</p>

<hr />

<p>Who would wish to escape suffering himself, when suffering
makes up so large a part of the experiences of his
fellow men? Who would seek by any base flight to avoid
Sorrow, when Sorrow alone can teach him the highest
meaning of Life?</p>

<hr />

<p>History is ever ready to point out how nations have been
benefited by calamities, and churches by persecutions.
Why not believe that the same rule holds good in our own
lives?</p>

<hr />

<p>Think what we should miss if all went smoothly with us!
Without pain, we should not know pity; without danger, we
should not develop courage; without receiving injuries, no
chance to show forgiveness; without affliction, no opportunity
for fortitude; without ingratitude, no means of proving
disinterestedness; without injustice, no occasion for
forbearance; without violence, no training in self-control.
Really, it seems that to encounter misfortunes must be the
finest fortune in life!</p>

<hr />

<p><!--284.png--><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a><span class="pageno">Pg 280</span>
The surgeon restores a stiffened joint or an atrophied
muscle by painful manipulations. Nothing but painful
experiences will restore a sluggish mind to activity and
enjoyment.</p>

<hr />

<p>To forget even for a short time those we have loved and
lost seems a lack of fealty to them; but if their influence
is ever present with us to our good, our joy is a worthier
memorial to them than would be endless repining.</p>

<hr />

<p>The memory of a great sorrow obliterates the slight
asperities of daily life.</p>

<hr />

<p>The mingling of tears is a transfusion of spirit. A sorrow
in common is the strongest of covenants.</p>

<hr />

<p>The only complete satisfaction of the sense of living is
its sacrifice.</p>

<hr />

<p>The sweetest joys are consoled sorrows.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
