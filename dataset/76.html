<p>The subject of "Obesity," including its
cause and treatment, has received during the
past few years a great deal of attention both
in England and on the Continent. Thousands
of persons have realized the extraordinary
benefit to be derived from the simple treatment
laid down in the following pages.</p>

<p>Some members of the medical profession
have, in the course of their practice, availed
themselves of the theory first propounded by
our Author, but have failed to acknowledge&mdash;either
through ignorance or inadvertence&mdash;the
source of their information.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it has been
deemed an act of justice, though tardy, to
place before the profession and the public a
translation of the original work of <span class="smcap">Dancel</span>,
modifications in matters of theory have, however,
been introduced, which the progress of
science imperatively demanded.</p>

<p>The invariable success which has attended
the treatment of several cases of obesity in
this city, in accordance with the principles established
by <span class="smcap">Dancel</span>, warrants the assertion
that the system is in every respect worthy of
public confidence.</p>

<p>To the many individuals of both sexes who
are afflicted with an excessive development of
fat, rendering the ordinary duties of life not
only irksome but ofttimes impossible,&mdash;an
easy method of reducing obesity, in nowise
interfering with the ordinary daily avocations
of the patient, nor demanding any diminution
in the actual amount of food consumed;
requiring the use of none but the mildest and
most harmless medicinal agents; improving
at the same time the general health, and augmenting
bodily and mental vigour,&mdash;must
prove acceptable.</p>

<p>The process will be found not a mere speculative
theory, but one based upon the great
laws of Nature, as manifested throughout the
whole of the animal kingdom.</p>

<h2 id="EDITION">AUTHOR'S PREFACE
<span class="smcap">to the</span>
THIRD EDITION.</h2></div>


<p>Can corpulence be reduced without injuriously
affecting the general health? This is
the grand question, and it is suggestive of another,
which is:&mdash;an inordinate amount of
fat once having been deposited in and among
the living tissues, is its presence necessary for
the preservation of the health and life of the
individual? My answer is,&mdash;most assuredly
no! Every one knows that an undue degree of
corpulence is not only accompanied with great
inconvenience to the individual, but is, in
most instances productive of ill health, and
too frequently of positive disease.</p>

<p>Having answered this question, another
occurs:&mdash;are there any substances generally
known to the profession which have the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
either to destroy fat or to cause its disappearance,
and which, at the same time, will have
no action upon the other tissues of the body?
My reply is most assuredly there are such;
and I will prove my assertion in this respect
to be correct, without resorting to the use of
subtle reasonings or invoking the aid of
learned theories, but will be content to rest it
upon the sure foundation of chemical science,&mdash;on
that science which teaches the action of
one body with another, which shews us that
in some cases no change whatever is effected
by the mechanical combination of two or
more indifferent substances; and that in other
instances, the chemical union of two bodies
will be productive of a third, having properties
wholly dissimilar from either of the two
original substances:&mdash;thus, that one or more
elementary substances or chemical compounds
may enter into combination with a fatty body
to produce a third, and yet have no power of
action whatsoever upon the muscles, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
bones, the nerves, or any other than the fatty
tissues of the living organism.</p>

<p>Knowing, therefore, the chemical constituents
of fat, and also those entering into the
composition of the several articles of diet
which are principally made use of in the civilized
world, we are enabled to say of a certain
class of alimentary substances, that such contain
the elementary ingredients of fat; and
that if you desire to escape the inconveniences
and evils attendant on corpulency, it will be
well to abstain from them; and that, on the
other hand, by making use of such and such
alimentary substances, and that too in any
quantity the appetite may prompt, there will
be no danger of suffering the inconveniences
alluded to, because such substances contain
but a minute portion of those elements which
enter into the composition of fat.</p>

<p>In the following treatise, a system for the
reduction of corpulence, based upon the above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
well-recognized truths, will be found fully
developed, and its correctness established by
means of numerous cases brought forward, in
which the results have been entirely satisfactory,
and where the patients have kindly permitted
me to state their names and addresses.</p>

<p class="p6 center large">OBESITY; OR, EXCESSIVE CORPULENCE.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="medium">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2></div>


<p>The physician has a twofold duty to perform.
He is called upon not merely to alleviate pain,
and to undertake the cure of disease, but he is,
moreover, required to lay down rules for the
preservation of health, the prevention of disease,
and its too frequent concomitant, pain.</p>

<p>Now, health being dependent upon the due
and regular performance of the vital functions
by the several physiological organs of the body,
any excessive development of these organs, or
undue manifestation of force on their part,
must, of necessity, be contrary to the general
health of the body, and be productive of disease
and pain.</p>

<p>In many persons there exists a constitutional
tendency to the excessive formation of blood,
occasioning a plethoric condition, and thereby
rendering the individual liable to a great many
diseases; others again suffer from an exalted
or diminished sensibility of the nervous system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
inducing some of the greatest woes to which
humanity is liable.</p>

<p>Many different elements are combined in the
structure of the various organs of the body,
and among these fat, in suitable proportion,
must be recognized as necessary for the due
and equable performance of the several organic
functions.</p>

<p>This fat, however, often becomes excessive,
giving rise at first to great inconvenience, after
a time inducing debility, and finally constituting
a disease (hitherto deemed incurable) termed
obesity.</p>

<p>The possession of a graceful figure may be of
little importance, in so far as the happiness of
most men is concerned; but as regards the
gentler sex, such is by no means the case.
Women are too apt to believe that, in the
absence of physical beauty, the possession of
mental and worldly treasures can only suffice
to render them endurable in their social relations.
Beauty, the richest gift of nature,
deserves to be carefully guarded by those who
happily possess it; corpulence, its enemy, is
destructive to the finest organization.</p>

<p>It is a painful sight to witness the many
instances of women, who, though still of youthful
years, and whose elegance of form, but a
short time since, did but enhance their unsur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>passed
loveliness of countenance, lose by degrees,
in the midst of an overwhelming fat, all
this relative and graceful harmony, and whose
ever increasing corpulence serves only to render
them ill-favoured and repulsive. In all cases,
so detrimental a change is much to be regretted;
but for ladies mingling in the fashionable
spheres of life, it is to be borne only when
such a condition can be shewn to be utterly
beyond all hope of relief.</p>

<p>Excessive corpulence has destroyed the
prospects of many, both men and women, by
rendering them incompetent to discharge the
duties of a profession by which they had hitherto
gained an honourable livelihood. Superabundance
of fat prevents an infantry officer
from following his regiment&mdash;a cavalry officer
from being long on horseback; and thus both
are alike compelled to retire from the service.
The operatic artiste, whose voice or
personal beauty had been hitherto a mine of
wealth to the theatre, falls into indigence,
because an excessive development of fat now
embarrasses the lungs or destroys her personal
charms.</p>

<p>Every one engaged in intellectual pursuits
will say that since he has increased in fat he
finds that he cannot work so easily as he did
when he was thin. The painter feels the want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of that vivid imagination which was wont to
guide his brush. The sculptor labours with
indifference upon the marble. The literary
man feels heavy, and his ideas no longer flow
in obedience to his will. The clerk in his
office is ever complaining of the efforts he is
obliged to make to resist an overwhelming
drowsiness which interferes with his calculating
powers, rendering him unable to compose
a letter, or even to copy one. Obesity, in fact,
lessens both physical and moral activity, and
unfits man for the ordinary business of life.</p>

<p>It was in conformity with this opinion, no
doubt, that the Romans at one time, wishing
to have no drones among them, banished those
of their fellow citizens who laboured under an
excessive development of fat. One can conceive
of the existence of such a law among a
people who condemned to a like punishment
any citizen known to be indifferent to the
public welfare.</p>

<p>We must admit, however, that it would be
a grave error to assert that all persons suffering
under an excess of fat are invariably wanting
in the finer feelings, or even in moral
energy. There are many living proofs to the
contrary. But it is among women chiefly that
we witness instances of great mental refinement
and susceptibility, in union with a body
steadily increasing to a lamentable size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Moralists have written that obesity is a sign
of egotism; of a good stomach, but of a bad
heart; and many may be found to endorse the
sentiment. Unhappily people are easily dazzled
with high sounding words, and the sententious
phrases of moralists. This is wrong;
for if we take the trouble to adopt for a
moment the opposite to that which they advance,
we shall often find that this opposite is
not void of reason. In support of this remark
many reasons can be advanced why a fat person
should have a good heart, and be endowed
with most excellent qualities. Corpulence, it is
true, usually indicates good digestive powers;
but good digestion is not incompatible with
goodness of heart. One who digests his food
easily ought to be better disposed towards
those around him, than the sickly creature
labouring under dyspepsia. What amount of
temper can be expected in those who daily
experience pain in the stomach while the
digestive process is going on? they can have
no joyousness of heart, but must continually
be in bad humour, too often seen in their contracted
and jaundiced features. It is a great
mental effort on their part to receive you with
even a seeming cordiality. We may always
accost a person with a degree of confidence,
whose skin is gracefully spread over a suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>cient
layer of fat. I may be mistaken, but in
my opinion we need not expect to meet in
such persons great mental anxiety, or intense
egotistical feelings.</p>

<p>Julius C&aelig;sar was warned a few days before
his assassination that an attempt would be
made upon his life:&mdash;Antonius and Dolabella
were accused of being the conspirators. "I
have but little dread of those two men," said
he, "they are too fat, and pay too much attention
to their toilette; I should rather fear
Brutus and Cassius, who are meagre and pale-faced."
The end justified C&aelig;sar's opinion.</p>

<p>With respect to lean persons, I shall not
undertake to oppose the general opinion that a
delicate organization is emblematic of a mind
endowed with a great member of most precious
and good qualities, frequently used with such
energy, as by its very strength to be the cause
of bodily weakness. But let us beware of
entering the domain of Lavater, Gall and
Spurzheim. We would rather say that the
emblem of health is a sufficient but not too
great rotundity of person&mdash;<i>mens sana in corpore
sano</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2></div>


<p>Sterility must be numbered among the infirmities
induced by excessive corpulence. This
is a well attested fact in reference to the
human species, and also as to the females of
the lower animals. One of the professors in
the Medical Faculty of Paris, while explaining
in his lectures how fat could interfere with
conception, never failed to cite the practice of
the peasantry, who hastened to send to market
those hens which became excessively fat, because
they then ceased to lay eggs. Even
plants lose their fertility by excess of fat. A
plant growing in a cultivated soil where it
finds a superabundance of food becomes sterile,
because the stamens are transformed into
petals, causing double flowers.</p>

<p>The rule is, in order that a woman should
be capable of conception, that she should be
regular&mdash;that is to say, that she should lose
each month a certain quantity of blood. Now
it is asserted by medical men that, in general,
those women who are thin, and who are almost
without exception fertile, lose much more blood
than fat women. Menstruation lasts with them
from five to ten days, whilst fat women lose but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
very little blood during two or three days at
the most. It may be added that in the first of
these three days the loss is considerable, the
second day there is scarcely any, and on the
third day there is more, but it then ceases.</p>

<p>Just in proportion as a thin woman becomes
fat, her menstrual flow diminishes, and so
much the more speedily, the quicker she becomes
fat. Some women who have thus
increased in fat have ceased to menstruate at
thirty-five, at twenty-five, and even at twenty
years of age. Some young girls, regular at
twelve or fourteen years of age, on becoming
fat, have ceased to menstruate and become
chlorotic.</p>

<p>One great result of the anti-obesic treatment
is, that while destroying the excessive amount
of fat, it causes women to become regular, and
thus favours conception.</p>

<p>Thin men in general possess greater virility
than those surcharged with fat, and in proportion
as this fat is developed virility is impaired
and finally lost. This infirmity happens to
many corpulent men at fifty, forty-five and
even forty years of age. Some who were very
very fat at the age of puberty, have been impotent
throughout life. There are facts which
prove that virility in man, like fertility in
woman, may be restored on losing a superabundance
of fat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2></div>


<p>The human skin is capable of great extension.
It may be distended to four times its
size, yet is not endowed with much elasticity.
On this account we may notice, in very fat
persons, rolls of fat about the neck, back,
buttocks, arms and pubis. The epidermis,
which constitutes the external layer of the
skin, is but slightly capable of extension.
When distended beyond a certain point, it
tears, and produces those white streaks which
are to be seen on the abdomen of pregnant
women, or of those who have borne children,
and also of those who have laboured under
severe dropsical ascites. These white streaks
may be formed upon all parts of the body,
when the skin is considerably distended: thus
they have been seen in a young woman twenty-eight
years of age, who weighed three hundred
and four pounds. In her case these white
streaks were to be seen upon the arms, the
shoulders, the breasts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The skin of the abdomen would not be sufficient
to retain the abdominal viscera <i>in situ</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
were it not that between these organs and the
integument there exists a fibrous or muscular
layer, in some places double, consisting of a
stronger and less extensible tissue than the
skin, in order to strengthen the abdominal
walls. It sometimes happens that this fleshy
layer, having yielded to a certain amount of
distension, occasioned by the volume of the
intestines, and of their surrounding fat, and
being thereby unduly stretched, permits the
passing between its fibres of a certain portion
of intestine or of fat, which, lying immediately
under and pushing the skin before it, constitutes
what is termed a hernia. Dropsy or
pregnancy are frequently the primary cause of
the various descriptions of hernia, termed inguinal,
crural, &amp;c. Umbilical hernia is that
which is usually produced by a too great
development of fatty tissue in the abdomen.
The umbilicus is that part of the abdomen
which is the least susceptible of dilatation.
When the belly becomes enlarged to a moderate
extent, the navel becomes depressed, shewing
that this part does not easily yield to the
pressure from within; but it is supported by
the recti muscles, those two bands of fleshy
fibres lying immediately beneath the skin, and
passing from above downwards, on each side
and close to the navel. In extreme develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>ment
of the abdomen, these muscles are displaced
from their normal position near the
umbilicus, and no longer lend it support. The
fibres of the umbilical ring are thus separated
by the pressure exerted by the abdominal fat,
and a portion passing through the fibres pushes
the skin before it. A small protrusion takes
place, which is not yet outwardly apparent,
because the remaining fibres of the umbilical
ring still afford considerable resistance, and
retain the ring concealed in the deep hollow
which is observable in the navel of fat persons.
In order to determine the existence of umbilical
hernia at this early stage, the patient should be
placed in the recumbent position. On introducing
the little finger into the navel depression,
and directing the patient to cough, we
feel an impulse against the finger which is not
to be felt, under the same circumstances, over
any other portion of the abdominal walls.</p>

<p>In some cases of hernia it is not absolutely
necessary to place the person in the recumbent
position, but in this case it is indispensable:
unless we do so the impulse cannot be felt, since
it cannot take place in the upright position.</p>

<p>In the year 1851, a lady consulted me. She
was then very fat, and the abdomen was greatly
enlarged. I said to her, "You have probably
umbilical hernia." "I have long feared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
such was the case," she replied, "but happily
I have not. Only a few days ago my own
physician examined me, and he declared that
I had not. He has advised me to wear an
abdominal supporter." Noticing her great
enlargement, I was not satisfied of the non-existence
of hernia. I begged to be allowed
an examination. Having obtained her consent,
I immediately detected, by the means I have
previously pointed out, a small hernia in the
depth of the navel cavity. She had great
confidence in her own physician, and told me
positively that I was mistaken. I recommended
her to see her own physician, and to
be examined again by him in the same manner
as I had examined her. There was no doubt
in my mind but that he would detect it, and
such was the case; but he said that it had
occurred since his previous examination: possibly
so. An umbilical truss was immediately
adapted; for it is only in hernia at its early
stage that we can hope for a cure by means of
a truss, and by removing the cause, that is to
say, by reducing the mass of fat existing in the
abdomen.</p>

<p>If the development of a small hernia is not
prevented, it gradually increases, and makes
its appearance upon the walls of the abdomen.
At first it is of the size of a small pear, a hen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
egg; afterwards it increases to six, eight, ten,
fifteen or twenty pounds weight. It then assumes
more or less the shape of a mushroom,
which is exceedingly troublesome, as it requires
to be supported by means of a hollow truss, a
species of box with springs. Umbilical hernia
is to be met in more than one half the number
of persons who measure fifty-five inches round
the abdomen.</p>

<p>Such is the progress of medical science, that
the following ideas as to the diseases which may
be engendered by excessive corpulence, would
have been deemed, twenty-five years ago, unworthy
of a doctor of medicine: a hundred
and fifty years ago they would have obtained
the applause of the physicians of those days.
At the present time I foresee&mdash;I am indeed
sure, that the medical profession will acknowledge
these same ideas to be founded upon
reason and observation, two indispensable
requisites in all that concerns the healing art.</p>

<p>When the system of medicine founded by
Borelli was in vogue, called the "Iatro
Mathematical," it would certainly have been
acknowledged that a superabundance of fat,
when developed in the human body, could
interfere with the vital organs in the performance
of their functions, and thus be the cause
of much disturbance and of many diseases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
But this would no longer have been admitted,
when Broussais, the distinguished author of
"Chronic Phlegmasia," in our own day, in
harsh and severe language, and with an air of
conviction, loudly proclaimed that all disease
resulted from local irritation, whence it was
irradiated throughout the organism, as in the
case when a sharp instrument pierces the flesh.
This theory was the very opposite to the teachings
of the majority of medical men of a previous
age, who maintained that local disease
resulted from a general disturbance of the
whole system.</p>

<p>Thus, if the stomach were affected, Broussais
called the disease a gastritis (or inflammation
of the stomach), which might induce disturbance
of the system at large; while many of
the old school would have said that if the
stomach were especially diseased, it was because
nature chose that channel in order to eliminate
from the body the morbid principle which in
the outset had attacked the entire system.</p>

<p>It belongs not to the subject on hand to
endeavour to signalize all the errors of the old
school, nor to set forth what truth there may
be in the system; but I would ask one simple
question. It has happened to every medical
practitioner to be called in to see a person
recently taken ill, and that he has said, "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
disease is not yet well characterized; by-and-bye,
or to-morrow, I shall be able to form an
opinion, and say what the disease is." But until
this "by-and-bye," until this "to-morrow,"
what happens to the patient? for it is evident
that there is sickness, a general ailment. And
when one particular portion of the body, an
organ, is principally affected, when the disease
has there manifested itself, as we say, shall we
be far wrong in saying that it is a kind of
crisis? It would be just what happens, only
more evidently, in those fevers which terminate
in a critical abscess.</p>

<p>Nor is it advisable that I should speak of
the founder of physiological medicine. His
vast labours are the result of great genius, and
have long influenced the medical world with
all the weight of a master mind. Having been
his pupil for many years, I shall never cease to
admire his life of scientific labour. Nevertheless,
I cannot refrain from remarking how
much he has done to lessen the spirit of medical
enquiry. By localizing all diseases, and
by his system of irritation, without taking
into account the constitution as a whole, how
greatly is the labour of the physician reduced!
how little knowledge is necessary on his part
to be deemed worthy of the title of Doctor of
Medicine! Once upon the highway of locali<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>zation,
once engaged in this contracted study,
there is no stop. It is no longer necessary to be
acquainted with all the organs, both in a state
of health and of disease; the extent of territory
to be explored is reduced. The fashion at the
present day is, that a physician of this school
should know only how to treat the diseases of
one particular organ, and rarely of two; that
he should be, in fact, a specialist. But are
not the principal organs of the body, for the
most part, mutually dependent on each other,
and all of them subject to a general <i>consensus</i>?
What is the consequence of this medical
specialism? Why, that every physician so
engaged thinks, and most conscientiously, that
the patient before him labours under that particular
disease to which he particularly devotes
his attention. This is perfectly natural. The
mind of man is so formed, that it is narrowed,
and loses its powers of comparison and of
judgment, whenever it is concentrated and
brought to bear solely upon one subject, one
single object. Man is no longer capable of
reasoning upon a science or an art, when he
puts it out of sight as a whole, in order to
devote himself entirely to one of its parts;
but ends by making the subject of his study
the principal point, the all-important one,
whence flow, in his opinion, all the rest; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
finally assumes that a part is equal to the
whole. When a patient complains of palpitation
of the heart, he prescribes a bleeding,
leeches, digitalis. If another complain of
sense of weight or oppression, bleedings, softening
syrups, troches, &amp;c., are prescribed.
If another complain of headache, dizziness,
with threatening apoplexy, he is bled.</p>

<p>Everything is treated locally, without inquiring
whether the evil be or be not the
effect of some general cause.</p>

<p>Among a vast number of general causes,
giving rise to disease, I purpose to treat of one,
and that is excessive corpulence, termed obesity.
In our recent medical works, no reference
is made to this morbid predisposition, in
regard to the diseases occasioned by it. I do
not mean to say that superabundance of fat is
the cause of all the ills that flesh is heir to;
but I am persuaded and do affirm that it is
often the primary cause of many diseases.</p>

<p>Thus, in cases of headache, there are assuredly
many which are produced by superabundance
of fat, because they commenced when
that superabundance began to appear, and
ceased on its being diminished. Frequent
headache, becoming periodic, is constantly met
with in fat people. Nothing is more common
among such persons than dizziness. In these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
cases, are not the blood-vessels oppressed with
fat interfering with a free circulation of the
blood, and is not fat therefore the cause of all
these troubles?</p>

<p>But it may be said that the blood produces
these affections, since, after loss of blood, the
patients are relieved. I do not agree with this,
and I say that the blood is not in such cases
the cause of these ailments; because fat people,
both men and women, have no more blood than
thin persons: I maintain that they have even
less. It is granted that loss of blood in cases of
headache, vertigo, alleviate and even cure these
affections; but only for a time; for eight days,
or a month or two at the most, and then gradually
reappear, and bleeding is again required.</p>

<p>This amelioration, these momentary cures,
produced by blood-letting, are to be explained
in such cases by saying that the quantity of
blood, although not so great in fat as in thin
people, is impeded in its circulation, and that
loss of blood, by still further diminishing the
quantity, facilitates for a while its passage
through the blood-vessels.</p>

<p>This method is consequently only palliative;
it does not attack the root of the evil. Bleeding
takes away blood which is troublesome
only in consequence of the excess of fat;
for every physician is aware that repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
bleedings tend to the development of fat in
an extraordinary degree. Fat people insist
upon being bled at more frequently recurring
periods, because their corpulence continues to
increase, and headaches and dizziness become
more frequent. The seemingly useful remedy
increases the cause of the trouble.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the temporary relief, and
apparent cure, corpulence finally produces such
a disturbance of the brain, or of some other
vital organ, as suddenly to produce death in
the course of an hour or two, with every
appearance of excess of health. Usually an
attack of serous or sanguineous apoplexy is the
cause of death in persons labouring under
excessive corpulence.</p>

<p>It is an important fact, and one which I
have noticed throughout twenty-five years of
medical practice, that wherever I have been
called to a case of apoplexy occurring in a fat
person, death has ensued in spite of every care
both on my part and of the other physicians
summoned together with myself to attend the
case. Bleedings, repeated three or four times
in the course of twenty-four hours, leeches
applied to the temples, mustard poultices, blisters&mdash;everything
has failed to prevent a fatal
termination. On the other hand, I can flatter
myself that I have successfully treated, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
means of bleeding, leeching, &amp;c., persons
of a spare habit of body, when seized with
apoplexy, some having made a perfect recovery,
and others retaining only a partial paralysis.
I am persuaded that physicians, if they
will reflect upon the results of their practice,
will acknowledge that this is their experience
also. In these cases an excess of fat is prejudicial,
therefore, to life. The existence of
an apoplectic tendency in certain persons is
admitted by all physicians, that is, in the corpulent,
with a short neck. Fat plays a most
important part in such a constitution. Many
persons have naturally a short bony framework
of the neck; but these persons, on becoming
fat, have scarcely any neck; and those in
whom the neck is naturally long, on the supervention
of fat about the shoulders, chest, and
lower portion of the face, become short-necked.
The much-dreaded predisposition to apoplexy
is consequent upon the development of fat.
It will be seen, on reading the remarks upon
the cure of obesity, that in those cases where
there has been a reduction in the amount of
fat, this tendency to apoplexy and cerebral
disturbance has disappeared.</p>

<p>Asthma, bronchitis, bronchorrh&oelig;a, pulmonary
catarrh, in fat persons, both male and
female, do they terminate favourably? If so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
it is only for a while, to return, again to disappear,
and finally to remain permanently, with
a more or less constant cough, expectoration
and oppression. In such cases, permanent
cure becomes impossible, unless assisted by a
reduction of fat. How are these phenomena
to be explained? Some physicians will say
that the lungs, being oppressed, and their
movements constrained by neighbouring parts,
and by the abdominal viscera, become obnoxious
to inflammation; while others will maintain
that these bronchial and pulmonary affections
of fat people, are due to an afflux of
humours to the part. Explain the presence of
these affections in either way, I am persuaded
that a reduced corpulency will be favourable
to the restoration of health. The cases which
I shall hereafter adduce will sustain my views.
Let us enquire into the cause of those frequent
palpitations and dull pains in the region of the
heart so common in persons of excessive corpulency.
Pharmacop&oelig;al remedies are for the
most part unavailing in these cases. We shall
find, further on, in our cases of recovery, that
they have disappeared simultaneously with the
undue <i>embonpoint</i>, a proof that they frequently
arise from obstruction to the motion of the
heart. The fat which overloads it and the
neighbouring viscera, occupies too large a por<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>tion
of the space necessary for the free execution
of the heart's movements, and hence the
spasms, sense of oppression, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The fatty liver is well known to be a liver
containing in its substance more than the normal
amount of fat; a morbid condition intentionally
induced in certain animals for the
purpose of gain. In man the liver often becomes
surcharged with fat, giving rise to
obstruction of the liver. The term, obstruction,
conveys an idea of the disease arising
from this cause. The liver secretes bile, which,
in order to reach the duodenum, flows through
a small duct. If this duct be compressed, the
flow of bile is impeded, and the result is uneasiness
and disease. The liver is traversed by
a vast number of arteries and veins, through
which, in a condition of health, the blood finds
a ready passage. If, however, an undue development
of fat should take place in the tissue
of the liver, these vessels become compressed.
The inferior vena cava receives all the blood
emerging from the liver, and conveys it to the
right side of the heart, thence to be sent to the
lungs, to undergo that a&euml;ration which, by
changing it from venous to arterial blood,
renders it fit for the nourishment of the various
parts of the body. Any obstruction to
the circulation through the liver must necessa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>rily
give rise to the most serious consequences;
for the blood which it contains is in no wise
fitted for nutrition.</p>

<p>In case of obstruction to the circulation
through this organ there may arise swelling of
the legs, thighs and of the abdomen. It is one
of the recognized causes of abdominal dropsy,
<i>ascites</i>; of dropsy of the lower extremities,
<i>anasarca</i>. Hence arise those frequent swellings
of the legs, with their attendant incurable
ulcers, so often met with in fat people. And
when we reflect that the venous circulation is
carried on by means of a vital power which
has to overcome the force of gravity, causing
the blood to flow from below upwards, from
the feet towards the heart, we can readily understand
how easily any slight obstruction in
the liver may give rise to serious consequences,
while on the other hand it will be manifest,
that the liver being freed from its excess of fat,
the venous circulation will be re-established,
and those troublesome affections alluded to,
therewith got rid of.</p>

<p>However, every medical man does not see,
or is not willing to see matters in this light.
Many will insist that this hepatic obstruction
is a chronic hepatitis, or chronic inflammation
of the liver, which is to be subdued by the
lancet, leeches, blue pill, Vichy water and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
vegetable diet. And what becomes of the
patient? I know I shall always remember a
circumstance which occurred in 1829. I was
at that time a surgeon attached to the military
hospital of the Val-de-Gr&acirc;ce, where Broussais,
the illustrious founder of physiological medicine,
was head physician. It was my duty to
make the <i>post mortem</i> examinations, to record
the several abnormal conditions found to exist,
and which had been the cause of death. Upon
one occasion, while thus engaged, Broussais
entered the amphitheatre, saying, "Bring your
instruments with you, we are going to hold a
<i>post mortem</i> in the city." We went to the
house. A statement was required to be put on
record as to the organic lesions which had
produced death in the case of a young woman,
about 25 or 26 years of age, belonging to a
wealthy and noble family. It was of importance
to have such a document, because the
mother of this young woman had died at an
early age, and the family wished to be able to
prove in a court of law that death had not
occurred in consequence of any hereditary disease.
Broussais and I entered the room where
lay the body of the deceased. We met there
two of the professors of the Faculty of Paris,
another physician, and the usual medical attendant
of the family. A few words passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in reference to the previous ailments of the
deceased. The family physician, a young man
imbued with the principles of Broussais, told
us that he had been in attendance upon the
deceased lady about a year before, for a disease
other than that which had caused her
death; that he had cured her by means of
bleedings and leeches, and that after her recovery
she had enjoyed the advantages of sea
bathing; that in the illness which had just
terminated fatally, he had made use of bleedings
and an antiphlogistic regimen. The body
of the deceased being removed from the bed
and placed upon a table was remarkable for
its excessive development of fat. The head
having been opened, the brain was submitted
to inspection and acknowledged to be healthy;
and the same of the tongue, the &oelig;sophagus,
the larynx, the bronchi, the lungs, the heart,
the spleen, the kidneys, the bladder: the womb
was somewhat engorged, and larger, heavier
than normal, but without any trace of inflammation.
All the principal joints were opened
and found healthy; likewise glands, arteries,
veins and lymphatics. The alimentary canal
was carefully examined throughout, without
discovering any organic lesion in the stomach
or large intestine. A few reddish brown spots
were, however, to be seen in the small intestine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Broussais upon this pronounced death to have
been caused by enteritis. Several of the medical
men, on the other hand, were unwilling to
admit that these reddish brown spots could
have caused death. The liver was then examined.
On separating one of the lobes a layer
of grease was left on the blade of the knife, as
is the case always in cutting into a fatty liver,
but which phenomenon is never manifested in
the case of a healthy liver. Those gentlemen
who had demurred to the reddish brown spots
as being the cause of death were of opinion
that the fatty liver, or which is the same thing,
the obstruction to the hepatic circulation had
produced death. Broussais could not agree
with this opinion, but dwelt upon the importance
of the testimony revealed by the reddish
brown spots, and a warm discussion ensued.
The <i>post mortem</i> being over, I returned to the
hospital, leaving these gentlemen in the midst
of a discussion as to how the medico-legal
statement accounting for the death should be
drawn up. At this time I was scarcely able
to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, although
I had already spent several years in the hospital
as assistant to M. Fouquier, and had frequently
listened to the teachings of Broussais,
which explained all diseases as due to irritation
dependent upon organic lesion; and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ended by shewing that the only rational treatment
for every morbid affection consisted in
blood-letting, leeching and low diet. It may
be mentioned as somewhat remarkable that at
the <i>post mortem</i> held upon the corpse of
Broussais, no organic lesion sufficient to account
for death was discoverable. In his own
person, the greatest possible contradiction to
his theory was thus presented. Since that time
my attention has been particularly directed to
this subject. In my own practice I have constantly
observed that when any obstruction
occurs in the liver no progress is ever made
towards the cure of diseases arising from this
cause, until the obstruction is overcome, and
if not overcome, that death supervenes; and
the cause of this death is to be found only in
the liver, as in the case of the lady just mentioned.
One of the earliest signs of obstruction
of the liver, is swelling of the legs and ankles,
appearing at first only towards evening, and
not to be noticed on the following morning,
but again appearing during the day. It disappears
during the night, because the horizontal
position favours the circulation in the lower
extremities. In this position fluids have not
to contend with the laws of gravity. It is
highly important that this evil should be at
once remedied. The treatment for the reduc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>tion
of <i>embonpoint</i> we shall find to be infallible
in such cases.</p>

<p>It is indubitable that almost all fat women
labour under some uterine affection. Some are
troubled with engorgement of the organ, with
a continual sensation of weight, and a dragging
of the sides and back. Others suffer from
falling of the womb and displacement. These
disorders are frequently attended with granulations
of the neck of the womb, menorrhagia,
leucorrhea, &amp;c. Pessaries were formerly the
usual remedies in such cases, but latterly it
has been well understood that in fat women
these conditions are due to the fact that the
womb, a body floating within the abdomen
is depressed, displaced by the large mass of
fat collected about the intestines. In order to
prevent this intestinal mass of fat from pressing
upon the womb, abdominal supporters have
been contrived; but this intestinal mass cannot
be so lifted as to set the uterus free, without
making pressure upon the stomach and lungs,
and so giving rise to a sense of oppression and
suffocation; and even should such means afford
some relief, it would prove but temporary: the
cause of the trouble would be still persistent.
In order to effect the replacement of the uterus,
the mass of fat must be got rid of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a well established fact that many fat
persons are troubled with skin diseases, which
resist every treatment, and a cure is effected
only when, from some cause or other, the person
has become thin. Would it be wrong to
say that in such cases the disease of the skin is
due to its over distension by fat, causing a
partial stagnation of venous blood and serous
fluid?</p>

<p>Among female patients who consult me in
reference to their obesity, many complain of
a general sense of uneasiness, with frequent
pains in the stomach, kidneys, headache, &amp;c.,
asserting that their excess of fat came on after
a confinement and when they had not suckled
the infant, and thence infer that their obesity
is owing to a decomposition of milk within the
system. I am not aware that this explanation
has ever been accepted, yet I do not understand
why it should not be received as valid,
since it is well known that any deteriorated
secretion may be absorbed and prove noxious
to the general system. Pus from an inflamed
vein may be thus re-absorbed, and the patient
under such circumstances almost invariably
dies. Why may not the secreted milk be likewise
re-absorbed? I have met with many fat
women from whose breasts milk constantly
flowed, although they had not borne children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
for the last ten years. A lady who has followed
my method of treatment for obesity,
says that she is certain that her excessive fat
arose from her not suckling her last child, and
that her milk turned into fat. She has had no
children for the last eight years, and whenever
she takes a child in her arms a peculiar feeling
causes an abundant flow of milk from her
breasts, which has all the properties of the
healthy secretion.</p>

<p>It is now well understood that corpulency is
the true cause of many diseases, yet it would
be folly to assign obesity as a cause of every
disease. To do so would be to detract from
the value of the anti-obesic treatment. I feel
called upon, however, to relate the following
account given by one of my patients, the correctness
of which was vouched for by several
of her acquaintances. She had been subject
for many years to a nervous affection, the
attacks of which were so severe that she fell to
the ground, foamed at the mouth and clenched
her hands, but did not lose consciousness during
the fit, which usually lasted from ten
minutes to a quarter of an hour. Such are the
symptoms of hysteria. Two years ago this
lady went to the baths at Aix-la-Chapelle,
where she heard of the anti-obesic treatment.
Being very strong, she came to Paris and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
placed herself for two or three months under
my care. She had had several fits at Aix. I
do not know whether she had any during the
the first few days after her arrival in Paris, but
at the end of a month she told me she had
been perfectly free from them, and trusted that
this change was due to my treatment. Such
has really been the case; for since this lady
has lost her corpulence, she has been free from
hysterical seizure. I am aware that many thin
women are hysterical. When, however, this disease
is met with in a corpulent person, and that
it disappears under the anti-obesic treatment,
the cure may perhaps be fairly assigned to the
treatment. Excessive corpulence is the cause
of many affections which are often with difficulty
characterized by physicians. The superintendent
of a large manufactory at Belleville
received a severe blow upon the left side, several
years ago. Latterly he has become very
corpulent, subject to dizziness and headache;
moreover the left leg is swollen, and he suffers
pain in the side which had been bruised. Professor
Cloquet first recommended bleedings,
then leeches, afterwards frictions and plaisters.
The patient at length, wearied with the aggravation
rather than the amelioration of his ailings,
came to consult me in the month of
April, 1853. In the course of two months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
under my treatment he has lost his excessive
corpulence, is free from pain in the side, his
leg is no longer swollen; he is active, and has
now no fear of being obliged to give up his
business. This is another instance of disease
due to obesity.</p>

<p>After reading the preceding remarks, some
astonishment must be felt that medical writers
have paid so little attention to the subject of
corpulence. It has been said not to constitute
a disease: that it is a normal condition: that
it is a condition intermediate between health
and disease: that a fat person is predisposed
to disease.</p>

<p>For my part I cannot comprehend a condition
between health and disease, with corpulence;
and if such do exist it is attended with
those infirmities and serious inconveniences
already mentioned. Predisposition to disease
and morbid tendency are, in the case of persons
labouring under obesity, the precursors of
serous or sanguineous apoplexy, obstructions,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>In fine, obesity is not always a disease,
because it does not always cause suffering;
but it ought, nevertheless, not to be neglected,
because life cannot be of long duration under
such circumstances, and may terminate suddenly
at any moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of the various duties of a medical
career, I flatter myself that I have not
fallen into an error, too frequent with medical
men, that of referring all diseases to one single
cause. Suspicion may arise that I have fallen
into such an error, because I speak here only
of those diseases consequent upon excessive
corpulence; but I pray the reader to remember
that a vast number of diseases exist which
are altogether independent and foreign to
obesity. It was, however, necessary that I
should point out those morbid phenomena
which are due to an excessive development of
fat in the system.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2></div>


<p>Physical beauty, like virtue, is a type to
which all approximate in different degrees,
and which, when not wholly departed from,
admits the possessor among the number of the
accepted in the eyes of the world; but if, in
the case of outward figure as with inward
morality, any human attribute should appear
distorted or unseemly, it gives rise immediately
to a feeling of displeasure and aversion.</p>

<p>Occupied at present with the consideration
of physical form only, it may be averred that
one of the most frequent deformities of the
human body consists in an excessive development
of fat.</p>

<p>In accordance with the opinions of able
physiologists, fat ought to constitute one-twentieth
of the entire weight of the body in man
(in the female about one-third more than in
the male). It consists of a multitude of minute
cells, frequently forming large masses held
together by a very delicate membrane, the
areolar tissue, which serves as a reservoir, and
prevents the fat (which is fluid during life)
from floating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>When once fat begins to make its appearance
in more than ordinary amount, there is
no reason why this augmentation should naturally
cease at any given point. This corpulence
continues to increase until some disease,
often occasioned by the condition itself, terminates
this frightful increase of size.</p>

<p>Cases of obesity are rarely met with in
mountainous countries, and those having a
great elevation above the level of the sea,
where the atmosphere is dry; whilst they are
frequent in valleys and plains at the level of
the sea, having a moist atmosphere.</p>

<p>Men are less subject to obesity than women.
The areolar tissue which contains the fat is
firmer in the male than in the female, and is
not so readily distended by the accumulation
of adipose matter. Corpulence is usually developed
after the body has acquired its full
growth, but childhood is not exempt.</p>

<p>Not long ago, a child of four years old was
exhibited at Paris, which weighed one hundred
and four pounds. Dr. Coe, an English physician,
makes mention of a man named Edward
Bright, who weighed one hundred and four
pounds at ten years of age; at twenty, three
hundred and fifty-six pounds; and thirteen
months before his death, five hundred and
eighty-four pounds. Another person, a native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of Lincolnshire, weighed five hundred and
eighty-three pounds, and was ten feet in circumference:
he died in his twenty-ninth year.
In another instance a man weighed six hundred
and nine pounds: his coat, when buttoned,
could contain seven medium-sized persons.
A case is recorded of a man who
weighed six hundred and forty-nine pounds,
and measured four feet three inches across the
shoulders. In the "Javannah News," for
June, 1853, the following case is communicated
by a medical writer: "A young man, who
lived about eighteen miles from Batavia, was
remarkable for his great size. When twenty-two
years of age, he weighed five hundred and
sixty-five pounds. He continued to increase
to over six hundred pounds. He lived upon
his plantation in easy circumstances. Four
weeks since, his weight began to increase at
the rate of a pound and a half, and subsequently
two pounds a day. He died one day
last week, suddenly, while sitting in his arm-chair.
Three days before his death, he weighed
six hundred and forty-three pounds." Dupuytren
has recorded the case of one Mary Frances
Clay, of whom a plaster cast is preserved in
the Museum of the Ecole de M&eacute;decine, at
Paris. This woman, a native of Vieille Eglise,
was of humble parents. Her husband travelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
as a pedler from town to town. When thirty-six
years of age, she was no longer able to
accompany her husband, and took her place at
the door of a church, to beg her bread. Her
height was five feet one inch, and her circumference
five feet two inches. Her head, which
was small in proportion to her size, was almost
lost between two enormous shoulders, giving
her an appearance of immobility. A furrow,
several inches deep, was the only boundary
between the head and chest. Her breasts
were enormous. Looking at her from behind,
the shoulders were elevated by fat, and formed
two huge protuberances. The arms stood out
from the body, in consequence of cushions of
fat in the armpits. On observing the plaster
cast of this person, the right side will be seen
to be much more developed than the left,
owing to her habit of lying on that side, and
the fat gravitating towards it. For several
years she was able to walk from her dwelling
to the station at the church door, about a mile;
but finally she was compelled to stay at home.
She suffered, while walking, from loss of breath,
and had violent palpitations of the heart. She
was unable to lie down, from a sense of impending
suffocation, and was obliged to retain
an upright position night and day, seated in
an arm-chair. Under these circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
nature soon gave out. She fell sick, and was
taken to the hospital, where she died. About
twenty years ago there was a German in
Paris, named Frederick Arrhens. He was then
twenty years of age, and weighed four hundred
and fifty pounds. In circumference he
measured five feet five inches, which corresponded
exactly with his stature. He was poor,
and had lived chiefly on vegetable and milk
diet.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to describe obesity,
since it is known at the first glance. The face
is animated; the circulation is impeded, and
renders the complexion turgid, and sometimes
almost of a deep wine-colour. The eyes suffer
from this impeded circulation; they are sparkling,
and frequently suffused with blood.
The ears, which are generally colourless in
health, are, for the most part, red in those
labouring under obesity. The circulation
through the head being greater than through
any other part of the body, and being impeded,
an almost continual perspiration with great
heat is established; thus it is that fat people
can seldom bear to have the head covered; in
some cases it even produces dizziness. As this
condition progresses, if fortunate enough to
escape threatened cerebral affections, the blood
loses its chief characteristic, and becomes wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>tery;
such persons are pale and flabby. The
integument of the lower part of the face is
capable of great distension, and here, in obesity,
fat accumulates, and forms on both sides
an unsightly mass, sometimes reaching to the
chest. A roll of fat is often found on the back
of the neck. The trunk becomes enormously
developed, and the breasts particularly enlarged.
The arms are very fat; and as the
areolar tissue which surrounds the wrist is of a
close texture, fat cannot accumulate there, and
the skin not being distended, a deep groove or
furrow is formed, as is the case in very fat
children. The hands usually participate in
this excess of <i>embonpoint</i>, but at a later period
than other parts of the body. The abdomen
attains a vast size, and impedes walking; so
that a person labouring under obesity carries
the head erect, and the body thrown back, as in
the case of a pregnant woman, in order to preserve
the necessary equilibrium and not fall forward.
The intestinal mass, with its surrounding
fat, being connected with the kidneys, by its
weight gives rise to a dragging sensation, and
causes pain on walking. It also pushes up the
diaphragm, compresses the lungs and the heart,
and becomes one of the causes of the sense of
oppression complained of by fat people. Many
such, especially females, have between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
abdomen and the thighs deep furrows, which
become scalded, and require the application of
starch, or of some other powder, as is the case
with infants when very fat. The integument
of the thigh is readily distensible, and allows
the deposition of fat as far down as the knee
joint. At this point the areolar tissue is more
dense, and less in quantity. The skin of the
thigh, being thus distended, forms large folds,
falling over the knee joint. The legs become
likewise enlarged, frequently engorged, and
troubled with varicosities, more especially towards
the lower portion of the limb. Gradually
the feet participate in this engorgement.</p>

<p>This general view of the outward appearance
of the body of a person labouring under
obesity, may give some idea of the disturbance
which an excessive amount of fat can produce
when situated within the body. On the outer
surface it causes an extraordinary distension of
the integument, giving rise, as we have before
said, to various diseases, such as pimples, boils,
eczema, prurigo, &amp;c., which can only be cured
by a reduction of corpulence. In the interior
of the organism this same excess of fat causes
displacement of the viscera, interferes with the
due performance of their functions (as we have
already explained), and leads to the sudden
death of the patient, whilst occupying his arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>-chair
rather than his bed, for he can rarely
assume a recumbent position.</p>

<p>It has been said, moreover, that excessive
corpulence modifies the intellectual faculties,
diminishes their power, and may even completely
annihilate them. The incessant desire
for sleep, the somnolence with which fat people
are tormented, is sufficient proof of the correctness
of the assertion.</p>

<p>The experience of all medical men goes to
shew that when persons of obesity are attacked
by any acute form of disease, they succumb
more easily than those possessing an ordinary
<i>embonpoint</i>. Death usually occurs in such
cases unattended with great suffering. Destruction
goes on so quietly and imperceptibly,
that the physician becomes aware of it only
when it is too late to grapple with it.</p>

<p>Excessive corpulence is promoted by want
of sufficient exercise, riding in a carriage,
lying in bed too much, and the continued use
of the warm bath. Having been told by many
females, as I have said before, that their <i>embonpoint</i>
had commenced after giving birth to
their last child, which they had not suckled,
and that they attributed the development of
this <i>embonpoint</i> to their not having suckled
the child, it may be asked, can this be assigned
as one of the causes of excessive corpulence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
females? I mention these facts without venturing
at present to give an opinion.</p>

<p>Some physicians, and many of the laity,
think that repeated bleedings tend to the
development of fat. For my part, the fact is
indisputable, both theoretically and as the
result of experience. Bleeding removes a portion
of the blood, which is flesh in a fluid state,
having for its object not only the nutrition of
the several organs, but also the stimulation of
the heart's movements, and thus the maintenance
of life. Taking a little blood, is taking
a little of that which maintains life, and is
therefore a weakening of every organ of the
body. Areolar tissue, which becomes more
extensible in proportion as the body becomes
more feeble, must have its power of resistance
diminished by the bleeding, and more readily
permit the deposition of adipose matter. This
affords an explanation of the fact stated by
many of my female patients, that their excessive
corpulence had manifested itself subsequent
to repeated blood-lettings.</p>

<p>Bleeding encourages the development of
fat in the lower animals, as well as in the
human species; a fact well understood by
cattle-breeders, who put it in practice in the
case of cattle which they wish to fatten. The
only exception made by them to this rule, is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
reference to those animals which have a soft
and yielding skin, as more frequently happens
with beasts of a red-and-white colour, which
are said to fatten readily. With this intention,
agricultural writers recommend the use of
blood-letting. An article which appeared in
an agricultural journal recommends that every
animal intended for fattening should be bled
twice, at an interval of a few days.</p>

<p>Some people think that exercise on horseback
is apt to produce corpulency, while others
entertain a different opinion. The former
maintain that persons whose business requires
them to be much on horseback, are frequently
fat; a remark which is made especially in
reference to cavalry officers, and which is quite
true. But the following explanation may
be offered: A man on horseback undergoes
severe exercise; and if he possesses a strong
constitution, and takes a sufficient amount of
food, this exercise will facilitate the digestive
function, and the volume of his body will be
increased. But it is necessary that the horseman
should be of a very vigorous constitution.
In truth, few cavalry officers are corpulent,
and these few are to be met with among those
who are somewhat advanced in life, and who
are by nature well adapted to the profession.
The greater number of cavalry soldiers, whe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>ther
officers or privates, suffer much at first
from fatigue. The young men who join a
cavalry regiment soon grow thin, and, with but
few exceptions, remain thin so long as they
are in the service; and indeed it has happened
that both in the case of officers and privates,
in consequence of not being able to endure
horse exercise, they have been obliged to
be transferred to the infantry. It is therefore
incorrect to regard this kind of bodily exercise
as favourable to the development of corpulence.</p>

<p>For the development of obesity, there must
exist a certain predisposition. We meet with
many who do all in their power to grow fat,
and who still remain thin, because, no doubt,
they possess some peculiarity of organization
which prevents the development of fat.</p>

<p>Obesity may be hereditary; that is to say,
the father or the mother may transmit to their
children a peculiar formation, having a tendency
to make fat. From certain physiological
conditions, we may recognize at an early age
a natural tendency on the part of some persons
to become corpulent. In the young of
both sexes, where this predisposition exists, the
face is broad and short, the eyes round, and
the nose short and thick; the hands and feet
are small, and there is a general roundness of
limb. When possessed of such an organiza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>tion,
obesity may be warded off by a rational
system of diet, to be indicated in the following
pages. But the immediate and producing
cause of corpulence is to be sought and discovered
in the character of the food. The present
system is founded upon this principle.
Medical authors assert that food has a most
important bearing in the production of corpulence.
They forbid the use of meat, and
recommend watery vegetables, such as spinage,
sorrel, salad, fruit, &amp;c., and for beverage water;
and at the same time they direct the patient to
eat as little as possible. These instructions,
like too many others, are given because they
are asked, and that in every disease, curable
or incurable, the physician is bound to offer
some advice. Medical men themselves put no
faith in them, since they pronounce obesity to
be incurable.</p>

<p>Having devoted a great deal of attention to
this enquiry, I have arrived at the conclusion
that it is not to be wondered at that obesity
should be incurable, because the very means
which have been recommended to overcome
it, are exactly those best fitted to induce and
maintain it.</p>

<p>I lay it down as an axiom, in opposition to
the received opinion of centuries, that a very
substantial diet, such as meat, does not develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
fat, and that nothing is more capable of producing
the latter than aqueous vegetables and
water.</p>

<p>It is a principle which at first sight may
appear inadmissible. Nevertheless, the consideration
of a few physiological and chemical
facts, within the comprehension of everybody,
will suffice to prove its correctness.</p>

<p>The most favourable physiological condition
for the production of fat, in man as in the
lower animals, is a large extent of intestinal
absorbent surface, the absorbent vessels being
proportional in number to the amplitude of
the intestinal surface. The intestines, however,
are conformable to the nature of the
aliment. The intestines are small in the lion,
tiger and panther, because their food consists
of a small quantity of flesh. The ox, on the
other hand, a herbivorous animal, possesses an
enormous paunch, to contain the large mass of
food, yielding but little nutritive matter; consequently
the herbivora must have a larger
absorbent surface than the carnivora. The
length of the intestinal tract in herbivorous
animals is equal to fifteen times the length of
the body; in the carnivora the length of the
intestines is about three times that of the body;
while in the tiger, feeding exclusively on blood,
it equals only the length of the animal. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
this respect man holds an intermediate position,
the intestines being equal in length to
about five or six times the height of the individual.
This provision of nature is in keeping
with the character of his food&mdash;partly animal,
partly vegetable. It is at his option, however,
to modify this natural condition, by living
wholly upon meat or wholly upon vegetables.
A person whose food is very substantial, but
small in quantity (as, for example, meat), does
not possess the dilated stomach and intestines
of the vegetable feeder, and consequently has a
less absorbent surface than the latter. Among
animals, we notice that the carnivora have
naturally but little fat, scarcely any belly, but
an enormous development of muscular power;
whilst the herbivora are more or less laden
with fat. Among men, it may be noticed that
the corpulent shew a preference for vegetable
and farinaceous food, and partake largely of
water, beer, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If we examine this question from a chemical
point of view, we obtain the most satisfactory
evidence that flesh must be productive of less
fat than vegetable matter. The composition
of human fat in 100 parts is</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" summary="fat">

<tr>
<td class="tdl">Carbon</td>
<td class="tdrb">79.000</td>

</tr>

</table>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The principal constituents of fat, therefore,
are carbon and hydrogen. Again, chemistry
teaches that all food not consisting of flesh,
such as vegetables, farinacea, sugars, &amp;c.,
resemble fat, being chiefly composed of carbon
and hydrogen; and, still more, that fat exists,
already formed, in some vegetable substances,
as oil of olives, oil of nuts, and oleaginous
seeds. If, therefore, we introduce into the
system substances rich in carbon and hydrogen,
we must make fat as inevitably as the bee
makes honey from its elements contained in
the flowers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we learn also from chemistry,
that one of the principal constituents
of meat is nitrogen, an element which does not
enter into the composition of fat. Food consisting
chiefly of meat must be less productive
of fat than food mainly composed of carbon
and hydrogen, such as vegetables, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Distinguished chemists have endeavoured to
shew in what manner the development of fat
takes place in the animal economy. A paper
was read by me before the Academy of Sciences,
at Paris, on the 15th December, 1851,
from which the following extract is made:</p>


<p class="i2 p2">"Three different opinions are entertained by
distinguished chemists, who have given atten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>tion
to this subject. The first, that of Dumas,
maintains that the fatty matter of the body is
derived solely from substances analogous to fat
in composition, which pre-exist in the food.
The second opinion, that of Liebig, is to the
effect that the formation of fat is due to a
modification of those ternary compounds which
constitute so large a proportion of the food of
animals. The third opinion suggests that fat
may arise in consequence of some special fermentation
taking place in the stomach.</p>

<p class="i2">"Numerous experiments have been made,
in order to determine which of these opinions
is correct; but it may be safely said that no
satisfactory conclusion has been arrived at.</p>

<p class="i2">"In the first place, the experiments have
never been conducted under circumstances
favourable to the formation of a correct opinion.
It is obviously of the first importance,
when conducting experiments of this nature,
that the food should be supplied so as not
to interfere with the tone of the general health,
considered morally as well as physically. We
can conceive that the deprivation of liberty,
in the case of an animal usually in the enjoyment
of freedom, may render the experiment
of dubious import. Although man is omnivorous,
it is impossible that any one can
submit, for a great length of time, to live upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
one kind of food only, without suffering a
sense of loathing.</p>

<p class="i2">"What inference can be drawn from those
experiments, made for the purpose of ascertaining
whether sugar is capable of producing
fat, when they were made upon pigeons and
doves, which were fed solely upon this substance;
at one time being deprived altogether
of water, and at another time allowing them
as much as they chose to drink?</p>

<p class="i2">"Chemists wished to know if butter could
engender fat, and doves have been gorged with
it, being deprived of all other food during the
few days that the experiment lasted; at the
end of which time they died, of course excessively
lean; and the experimentalists thence
concluded that butter does not produce fat.
What an extraordinary idea, to feed a granivorous
animal upon butter solely, in order to
test the question referred to! This experiment
forms the subject of a paper written by me, and
inserted in the proceedings of the Academy of
Sciences, for the year 1844.</p>

<p class="i2">"Other experiments upon animals, conducted
likewise by men of science, are less open to
criticism than the one just referred to; yet it
must be confessed that no safe inference could
be drawn from them. I am about to submit
a few established facts, which may throw some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
light upon the question as to the cause of the
development of fat.</p>

<p class="i2">"For several years past I have given much
consideration to the reduction of corpulency in
cases where it interfered with the comforts of
life, and I can reckon by thousands those who
have followed my instructions. I have established
it as a fact, without a single exception,
that it is always possible to diminish obesity,
by living chiefly upon meat, and partaking
only of a small quantity of other kinds of food.
Make use of whatever medicine you please, it
is impossible to obtain the same result in the
case of a person partaking indiscriminately of
everything which may be placed upon the
table. There is yet another condition, without
which success is impossible; that is, to absorb
but little fluid, whether in the shape of soup or
drink, or by means of the bath. A moist
atmosphere is favourable to the development
of fat: we increase in weight in wet weather.</p>

<p class="i2">"I have thousands of cases on record, in support
of my statement. Persons from all parts
of the world, who have followed my teachings,
have experienced a decrease of their corpulence."</p>

<p class="p2">The paper upon this subject ended by saying,
that according to my opinion, fat might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
be assimilated by either of the three several
methods set forth in the beginning of the essay,
one not forbidding the action of the others. I
begged to be acknowledged by the Academy
as the first who had established the fact that,
in order to reduce corpulence without interfering
with the general health, it is necessary
to live chiefly upon meat, avoiding an excess
of vegetable and aqueous food, or of any of
which the basis is carbon or hydrogen.</p>

<p>These chemical principles are founded upon
facts&mdash;upon observation. As I have said, carnivorous
animals are never fat, because they
feed upon a substance rich in nitrogen&mdash;flesh;
which flesh makes flesh, and very little fat.
They have no belly, because flesh, taken in
small quantity, suffices for one day, or twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>It has been objected that the carnivora do
not always obtain food when hungry, and that
they are often obliged to chase their prey for a
long time before catching it. This is true;
but on the other hand, carnivorous animals,
when domesticated and fed upon meat, are not
more fat, and have no belly. The celebrated
traveller, Levaillant, in his Travels in Africa,
says that he has seen, in the southern part of
the continent, flocks of gazelles, which live in
the interior, numbering from ten to fifty thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>sand.
These flocks are almost continually on
the move; they travel from north to south, and
from south to north. Those of the flock which
are in advance, and in the enjoyment of a rich
pasturage, frequently come upon the borders
of the settlements of Cape Colony, and are fat;
those composing the centre of the herd are less
fat; while those in the rear are extremely poor,
and dying with hunger. Being thus stayed
in their course by the presence of man, they
retrace their steps; but those which composed
the rear are now in advance, and regain their
fat, while those which were in advance become
the rear, and lose fat. Notwithstanding the
vast numbers which daily perish, their natural
increase suffices to maintain the integrity of the
herd. In connexion with my subject I may
state that these flocks are always accompanied
or followed by lions, leopards, panthers and
hyenas, which kill as many of them as they
please for food, devour a part, and leave the
rest to the jackals and other small carnivorous
animals, which follow upon their steps. Now,
these lions, panthers, leopards and hyenas,
which need make but the slightest exertion to
find food when hungry, are never fat.</p>

<p>It has been said, by way of objection to my
system, that butchers are generally fat, due to
their living upon meat. Now, I have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
some enquiries in this matter, and have satisfied
myself that butchers, as a general thing,
are not fond of meat, but live chiefly upon
vegetable food, and usually drink a great deal.
It has been said also that their good condition
is due to the atmosphere (filled with animal
miasm) in which they live, a supposition which
has yet to be proven. Again, it has been said
that hogs can be fattened upon horse-flesh.
My reply is, that they drink at the same time
a large amount of water. And here I may
remark, that the lard of hogs thus fattened
upon flesh is soft and watery, and is considered
by dealers to be of little value. It is evidently
not due to the flesh upon which these hogs are
fed, that their fat is soft and watery, but to the
great amount of fluid they imbibe.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those animals which are
enormously fat, live exclusively upon vegetables,
and drink largely. The hippopotamus,
for example, so uncouth in form from its immense
amount of fat, feeds wholly upon vegetable
matter&mdash;rice, millet, sugar-cane, &amp;c.
Naturalists long entertained the opinion that
this animal, living mostly in the water, fed
chiefly upon fish. It is now, however, well
ascertained that the hippopotamus never
touches fish, and is wholly a vegetable feeder.</p>

<p>The walrus, which, according to Buffon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
seems to afford the connecting link between
amphibious quadrupeds and the cetacea, is a
veritable mass of fat, and lives exclusively
upon marine herbage. The walrus of Kamschatka
measures from twenty to twenty-three
feet in length, sixteen to eighteen feet in circumference,
and weighs from six to eight thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>The following fact may be cited as a remarkable
proof that the quantity of fat in any
animal is mainly dependent on the character
of its food: Among the whale tribe, those
monsters in size, that of Greenland (Bal&aelig;na
mysticetus of Linn&aelig;us) possesses the greatest
amount of blubber, and it feeds upon zoophytes,
of which many resemble as much in character
the plant as the animal. The fin-backed whale
(Bal&aelig;na böops of Linn&aelig;us), which does not
feed upon mucilaginous matter, but upon small
fish, has a much thinner layer of blubber than
the former. The sperm whale or cachalot
(Bal&aelig;na physalus of Linn&aelig;us), which feeds
on mackerel, herrings, and northern salmon,
although nearly as long as the Greenland
whale, is much thinner. The layer of blubber
is not so thick as in the fin-backed, and yields
only ten or twelve tuns of oil; while the
Greenland whale yields fifty, sixty, and even
eighty tuns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Now, chemistry, as we have said, furnishes
a rational explanation of these facts. With
the exception of flesh, all alimentary substances
(the mucilaginous, the gummy, the saccharine,
the aqueous, &amp;c.) consist of carbon and hydrogen,
and fat is composed of the same elements.
Success in the treatment of disease would be
more frequent, if medical practitioners would
pay greater attention to the chemistry of the
vital functions; and the reason why certain
articles of diet have a greater tendency than
others to the formation of fat, would, by the
aid of the exact science of chemistry, be rendered
self-evident.</p>

<p>All medical writers agree that want of sufficient
exercise&mdash;as by lying too much in bed,
riding in a carriage, &amp;c.&mdash;is favourable to the
development of obesity. The explanation is
simple. We are all cognizant of the fact, that
the body is sustained chiefly by means of food;
but we also know that the atmosphere by which
we are surrounded, plays an important part in
the nourishment of the body. The atmosphere
we inspire contains oxygen gas, a portion of
which is destined to revivify the blood in its
passage through the lungs; another portion
we expel, we expire, no longer pure, but in
combination with carbon obtained from the
body, in the form of carbonic acid gas. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
proportion as the respiration is more active,
a larger quantity of oxygen is taken into the
system, and more carbon in combination with
oxygen is expelled as carbonic acid gas. There
is consequently a less amount of carbon left in
the system to form fat. The greater the activity
of the animal, the more frequent do the
respirations become. Having said this, it is
readily understood why want of exercise, riding
in a carriage, lying too much in bed, tend to the
development of fat; because, with this want
of activity, respiration is less frequent, and the
oxygen combines with a less amount of carbon,
and a larger quantity is left to enter into combination
with the existing hydrogen, forming
fat. Consequently the mountaineer, breathing
an atmosphere rich in oxygen, is generally less
prone to the formation of fat than the dweller
in the valley.</p>

<p>The Bedouin Arab, owing to the activity of
a nomadic life, is never fat. Our peasantry
are rarely over fat, unless they have acquired
wealth sufficient to relieve them from the necessity
for labor. Animals which are in constant
motion, such as the roebuck and the deer,
although feeding upon substances rich in carbon
and in hydrogen, have usually but little
fat.</p>

<p>Those birds which are continually on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
wing are never very fat. On the other hand,
birds or animals leading an inactive life readily
take on fat. A means frequently resorted to,
in order to fatten them, is to feed them in a
small enclosure. Some domestic animals are
even deprived of all power of motion in order
to hasten their fattening.</p>

<p>Among orientals, where the men remain
seated the greater part of the day, and the
women are obliged to stay in the house without
ever going out, frequent examples of obesity
are to be met with.</p>

<p>Nuns in their cloistered convents, prisoners
in jails often grow fat in spite of their wretched
food, because the air they breathe being deficient
in oxygen, withdraws but a small portion
of the carbon from the system, the remainder
going to the formation of fat. It is when the
human body has attained its full growth, and
especially in the decline of life, that fat in
excess begins to be developed. I am of opinion
that want of exercise is one of its principal
causes. With increasing age the step becomes
more guarded, and a repugnance is felt for all
bodily exertion. In this way the quality of
the air, and the quantity of oxygen it contains
have much to do with the formation of fat.</p>

<p>By virtue of that happy distribution and
balance of forces to be met with throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the universe, the expired carbonic acid gas of
men and animals is destined to the nutrition of
plants, which assimilate the carbon and set free
oxygen gas. Plants being thus chiefly composed
of carbon, are, when taken as food, rich
in the chief constituent of fat; and fat itself
is frequently a vegetable production. Mutton
fat resembles that of the cacao bean, and
human fat is similar to olive oil.</p>

<p>It is therefore clearly established that the
immediate and direct cause of the development
of fat in the case of men and animals is to be
sought in the nature of the aliment, giving, at
the same time due weight to the several general
conditions which have a tendency to favor
the development of obesity. All food which
is not flesh&mdash;all food rich in carbon and hydrogen
must have a tendency to produce fat.
Upon these principles only can any rational
treatment for the cure of obesity satisfactorily
rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="medium">ON THE TREATMENT OF OBESITY.</span></h2></div>


<p>It can scarcely be necessary that I should
record all the several methods which have been
proposed and adopted for the reduction of
obesity; yet, lest I should be charged with ignorance,
some mention must be made of the
several useless and contradictory opinions and
methods which have been adopted, frequently
to the serious injury of the general health of
the patient.</p>

<p>Some ancient authors inform us of the means
that were employed in former times by slave
dealers at Rome to render their merchandize
fat or lean, in accordance with the requirements
of the market. But these means, in our
present state of society, are no longer available.
I shall briefly say that the ladies of Rome, in
order to reduce the size of their breasts, which,
when largely developed, were considered unsightly,
were in the habit of using a poultice
composed of Lemnian clay, lime, sugar, parsley
and white of egg. I have used this poultice
to arrest the secretion of milk after childbirth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and under its influence the breasts have diminished
in size to such an extent that it was
manifest a reduction of the fat surrounding the
glands had taken place. Instead of Lemnian
earth, I substitute an argillaceous substance
possessing all its properties. This poultice is
the only remedial means worth recalling: all
the others which are given are based upon
superstition or some vulgar error. Thus it was
believed to be possible, by means of a surgical
operation, to remove with safety the fat <i>en
masse</i> from the abdomen, in the case of persons
labouring under obesity. This belief has derived
support from a story related by the historian
of a certain pacha named Schisman, who
it is said always had a surgeon accompanying
him in his travels, whose duty it was to remove
the fat from his abdomen whenever it became
troublesome.</p>

<p>In 1718, Rothonet, a Parisian surgeon, is
said to have delivered a well-known personage
of that time of an enormous belly. After the
operation the person became small and active.
Rothonet was soon besieged on all sides by a
crowd of people desirous of undergoing the
operation of delarding. Rothonet explained
that the person upon whom he had operated
had been afflicted with a fatty hernia protruding
from the umbilicus, and covering the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
external surface of the abdomen; that by removing
this mass of fat he had restored the
former agility of the patient; but that he
would never dare to open the abdominal walls
for the purpose of removing fat. Many people,
however, believe to this day that it is possible
thus to remove fat.</p>

<p>Cases are recorded of individuals of excessive
obesity, who, being subject to the authority of
an absolute master, have been submitted to
most rigorous treatment for the purpose of reducing
their fat. They have been shut up in
a room, and fed upon an amount of food only
sufficient to sustain life, and consisting solely
of dry bread and water. Dry bread and water
however, in sufficient quantity, and an endurable
captivity, are not infallible means of inducing
leanness. A foreign prince, still young,
and subject to the will of his father, has been
submitted to this treatment for some length of
time, in the hope that his excessive fatty development
might be arrested. But in spite of
violent exercise, and the use of medicinal
means, the prince weighs, at the present time,
over three hundred and fifty pounds. In the
case of horse-jockeys requiring to reduce their
weight to the necessary standard, we may observe
that, in order to accomplish their object,
they put on a large amount of extra clothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and take violent exercise (by running or otherwise)
during several hours, and afterwards,
while bathed in perspiration, are submitted to
violent friction by means of a coarse cloth.
The employment of such means is not devoid
of danger; but the fat lost is soon recovered if
the general health has not suffered impairment.</p>

<p>Drinking vinegar is a means unfortunately
too frequently resorted to for the reduction of
corpulence. This acid destroys the mucous
tufts of the absorbents in the alimentary canal,
and consequently only an insufficient quantity
of nutrient matter is introduced into the system,
thereby inducing a general wasting.
When death does not result, the patient is for
a long time, and frequently ever afterwards,
subject to gastralgia, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A lady once consulted me who, during a
whole month, had taken every morning, while
fasting, a spoonful of citric acid with syrup.
It had not the effect of reducing her <i>embonpoint</i>,
but had given rise to painful sensations
in the stomach, which lasted for several years.
I am sorry to say that I have known medical
men, who, from their standing in the profession,
ought to have set an example of prudence,
when consulted in reference to the reduction
of corpulence, have ventured to prescribe the
use of iodine, iodide of potassium, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
arsenic in small doses. Patients whom I have
seen, and who have followed these prescriptions,
have told me that they have been compelled
to abandon them before obtaining the
desired effect, owing to the troublesome consequences
attending the use of these powerful
medicinal agents. The law takes cognizance
of crime less serious than that committed by
the physician, who prescribes such poisons
when not imperatively called for.</p>

<p>Many authors, both ancient and modern,
and many physicians also, recommend, in order
to reduce obesity, that the patient should eat
a less amount by weight than the body loses.
By such means a wasting of all the organs of
the body would be simultaneously effected;
not only fat, but muscle, nerve, tissue, blood&mdash;all
must suffer.</p>

<p>At the same time these authors universally
forbid the use of meat, and permit only an
exclusively vegetable diet. Any one, after
reading the preceding pages, is competent to
judge how great must be the error of these
writers, who always end, however, by affirming
obesity to be incurable. Incurable, no doubt,
it is, by such treatment. But to diminish
obesity, without affecting the general health,
the patient must feed chiefly upon meat. I
say chiefly, because man, being naturally dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>posed
to partake of both animal and vegetable
food, cannot live exclusively upon meat without
prejudice to his general health. The use
of a small quantity of vegetable matter will
not prevent the diminution of fat. At a future
page the several alimentary substances will be
arranged from a chemical point of view, in the
order they truly occupy as reducing or inducing
obesity. For the present, it may be stated
that among alimentary substances, exclusive
of meat, those containing the greatest amount
of water, such as watery vegetables, sweet
fruits, &amp;c., have an especial tendency to develop
fat. The result of my own observation, in
a great number of cases, is in perfect accordance
with the chemical fact, viz., that the chief
constituents of fat are also constituents of
water. So that although a person should live
exclusively upon meat, and at the same time
drink a great deal, he would not experience
any perceptible reduction of fat. This affords
an explanation why many who eat very little,
but drink large quantities of water, beer, cider,
brandy or wine, labour under obesity. Whoever
desires to avoid corpulence must therefore
feed chiefly upon meat, partaking very sparingly
of any other kind of food, and at the
same time should drink but little.</p>

<p>Nor can it be supposed that, although obe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>dient
to the previous directions, the vast mass
of fat existing in the body of an obese person
will disappear in the course of a few hours.
They who are exceedingly anxious to get rid
of it speedily, whether for appearance sake, or
because it is productive of inconvenience, infirmity
or ill-health, must make use, at the
same time, of those medicinal agents which
help its removal. Among substances having
an affinity for fat, the alkalis hold a prominent
position; and these, when administered in the
usual medicinal doses, are productive of no
inconvenience, but increase rather than lessen
the appetite, and aid the removal of fat. Soap
pills have been in vogue for centuries, for the
cure of portal obstruction. Vichy water is
also recommended. The free alkali contained
in the soap pills and in vichy water, is the
active agent in such cases. Many persons are
known to have grown thin while using Vichy
water; and, on the other hand, many thin
persons have resumed their natural <i>embonpoint</i>
under its use. An emaciated patient, suffering
from liver disease, will regain his normal
weight, on recovery from the disease, whether
using Vichy water or not.</p>

<p>Cullen, in his Elements of the Practice of
Physic, mentions a Dr. Fleming, who had
sometimes succeeded in reducing obesity by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the use of soap pills; and the author himself
recommends, for the same purpose, abstinence,
together with the use of alkalis, that is, to eat
as little as possible of the least nutritive food,
such as vegetables, and to drink water. The
author states, as the result of his observation,
that fat persons must not be bled; that loss of
blood only weakens the system, and favors an
increase of obesity. Another author speaks of
the value of alkaline baths in the treatment of
the obese.</p>

<p>Under the head of "Obesity," in the Dictionary
of Medicine and Practical Surgery, we
find the following:&mdash;"Our colleague, Dr.
Melier, has witnessed the speedy reduction of
great obesity in a lady, under the use of bicarbonate
of soda and soda water, which had
been prescribed with another object in view.
If this effect should prove constant, we might
be inclined to agree with him, that alkaline
substances are capable of inducing saponification
of fat in the living body, and that the
resulting compound, being more soluble, is
more readily absorbed. Whatever may be the
explanation, it would be well to repeat the
experiment, and we shall endeavour to do so
upon the first opportunity."</p>

<p>I am not aware that the experiment has been
repeated; but if it has been, the result has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
probably not proved satisfactory; because, for
its success, the patient taking alkalis should
be fed chiefly upon meat, with a small quantity
of vegetables, and but little drink. Failing
these conditions, alkalis are powerless. Cases
do occur, of persons growing thin, who intentionally
have done nothing to reduce their fat.
In the same way it might happen that while
making use of alkalis, without observing the
precepts laid down, the fat might disappear.
Such a case would be exceptional, and extremely
rare.</p>

<p>Alkalis alone are incompetent to cure a case
of obesity: this is capable of chemical demonstration.
If a supply of fat, equal in combining
proportion with the alkali ingested, be supplied
by means of food to the body, the action
of the alkali upon the previously deposited fat
constituting the obesity, must be null. For
the speedy reduction of obesity, therefore, the
food must contain a less than ordinary amount
of the elements of fat, by making it to consist
chiefly of meat, and bringing about a reduction
of the superabundant fat by means of alkalis,
which should be administered in every variety
of form, in order not to induce a sense of disgust
on the part of the patient.</p>

<p>While undergoing this course of treatment,
the person should not be called upon to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the slightest change in his ordinary habits, or
in the amount of his daily labour. His appetite,
which ought to be excellent, should be
always satisfied; and while losing fat, he ought
to experience increase of muscular firmness
and vigour. Such have been the invariable
effects produced in those patients under my
immediate care, as will be fully shewn in the
cases about to be reported.</p>

<p>After ten or twelve days of this mode of
treatment, and with the help of alkalis, obesic
patients experience a feeling of freedom from
oppression, and already a reduction of fat has
become apparent. This diminution continues;
and by the end of the month, which is the
shortest period of treatment, the weight has
been reduced to the extent of ten pounds at
least; but if the instructions have been rigidly
observed, thirty pounds or even more. And
this course may be continued for six months
or longer, with marked improvement of the
general health.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="medium">CASES OF REDUCTION OF CORPULENCE.</span></h2></div>


<p>In the month of August, 1849, M. Gu&eacute;naud,
a master baker, still residing in the Rue St.
Martin, Paris, presented the following appearance:&mdash;Age,
twenty-eight years; height, four
feet eleven inches. His obesity was such that
he was scarcely able to walk, and whenever he
attempted to do so, suffered from difficulty of
breathing. When standing for a short time,
he experienced great pain in the region of the
kidneys. He was incapable of superintending
the workshop and attending the flour market,
duties which devolved upon him as manager of
an extensive bakery. An unconquerable drowsiness
overcame him the moment he sat down,
and rendered him unable to attend to his
numerous accounts. When in bed he was
obliged to be propped up by a number of pillows,
in a semi-recumbent position; for if his
head happened to be too low, he suffered from
vertigo, dizziness, &amp;c. His countenance was
suffused, and the veins of the head, especially
the temporal, were more than usually distended.
The slightest exercise was attended with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
excessive perspiration. The cerebral circulation
was so much impeded, that he could not
bear even the pressure of a hat; and asserted
that he would not dare to stoop, even were it
to insure him a fortune. In this distressing
condition he sought the advice of a physician,
under whose directions he was repeatedly bled,
and freely purged. He was recommended to
live upon the smallest quantity of food that
nature would permit, and to diet chiefly upon
watery vegetables, such as cabbage, turnips,
salad, spinach, sorrel, &amp;c., and only occasionally
to partake of a very small quantity of
meat. He was also directed to use active
exercise, to work in the bake-house, and to
take long walks. But he found it impossible
to follow the latter part of this advice, on
account of a feeling of impending suffocation,
and severe pains in the region of the kidneys.
He was therefore recommended to take exercise
on horseback; but this even could not be
borne, and in spite of every effort his obesity
was constantly on the increase. At last he
could not walk a quarter of a mile, and was
obliged to confine himself to the house, passing
his time in a listless, somnolent condition,
entirely deprived of all mental and bodily
energy. His mother, who lived in the neighbourhood
of Paris, having seen the advertise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>ment
of my book upon Obesity, and thinking
of the melancholy condition of her son, procured
a copy and read it. She thereupon
brought her son in a carriage to my office.
Gu&eacute;naud was quite out of breath from having
to ascend one pair of stairs; he seated himself
upon a sofa in my room, and soon fell asleep.
Occasionally he would wake up, and take some
part in the conversation. The mother and her
son went home, and on the following day
Gu&eacute;naud began to carry out the directions he
had received from me; and at the end of thirteen
days he was able to walk from the Porte
St. Martin to La Chapelle, where his mother
resided, delighted at having recovered the use
of his legs. What astonished him most was
that he had been able to perform the journey
on foot, without once taking his hat off. The
latter remark may appear trivial; it shows,
however, the great inconvenience he had been
wont to suffer from the violent perspiration
hitherto induced by the slightest exercise. By
the end of the month Gu&eacute;naud had reduced his
weight from one hundred and ninety to one
hundred and seventy-four pounds, and his circumference
round the belly from fifty to forty-three
inches. He was recovering his activity,
both of mind and body, and his respiration
was already considerably improved. The treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>ment
was continued two months longer, and at
the end of the three months his circumference
was reduced fourteen inches, having lost forty
pounds of fat. His muscular powers were now
much increased. Gu&eacute;naud had a very short
neck; the two masses of fat, which made his
cheeks appear continuous with his chest, have
disappeared. The line of the lower jaw is now
perfectly distinct, and without the slightest
wrinkle. Instead of his former aged appearance,
induced by obesity, his figure is now
youthful, his countenance intelligent and sparkling.
Before commencing my system of treatment,
the patient was in continual danger from
threatening head symptoms. It was generally
said, even by the medical men under whose
care he had placed himself, that he suffered
from excess of blood; yet he has not lost a
single drop during the whole course of treatment,
and is now free from somnolency, giddiness
and headache. The veins of the head are
no longer turgid, nor does he suffer from excessive
perspiration of the head.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that this man, at the present
time, has more blood in his system than he had
when labouring under obesity; but the circulation
being now free, all inconvenience has
disappeared.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to add that, owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
lungs being no longer oppressed on all sides
by a superabundance of fat, their movement
is unimpeded, air finds easy access, and the
difficulty of breathing, with sense of impending
suffocation, no longer exist. Gu&eacute;naud can
now sleep in the ordinary recumbent position.
Men of great corpulence, when walking, experience
severe pain in the kidneys, and this
arises from the enormous mass of fat which
surrounds these organs, inducing by its weight
a dragging sensation. Gu&eacute;naud, having lost
his big belly, is no longer troubled with this
uneasiness when walking.</p>

<p>With respect to this patient, and in all the
other cases which have come under my care,
it may be well to remark that the muscular
system has recovered its tone, and that the
muscles are harder than they were before treatment;
and I can safely say, without fear of
contradiction, that every person who has been
submitted to my system for the cure of obesity,
is convinced that his flesh, his muscle, has increased
both in firmness and in size.</p>

<p>I have had men under my care weighing
two hundred and fifty pounds. Upon the
occasion of their first visit, having felt their
limbs, I have said, "I can diminish your
weight by fifty pounds; but these enormous
muscles will be increased rather than dimin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>ished
in size. You must not expect a reduction
of more than fifty pounds; but fifty pounds
less of fat, distributed among organs overloaded
with it, will be highly beneficial to health."</p>

<p>Gu&eacute;naud is far from being thin, but he is
strong and muscular, and has the physical and
moral energy of a robust young man. His
enormous size had rendered him conspicuous
in that part of the city where he carried on
his business as a baker; but when he had
become reduced to the normal size of other
men, the change produced considerable sensation,
and excited curiosity as to the cause.
He has done justice to the treatment which
has made him once more a man. I will also
do him the justice to say that he has honestly
carried out my instructions. A beefsteak or a
couple of cutlets, with a very small allowance
of vegetables, together with half a cup of
coffee, constituted his breakfast. Dinner consisted
of meat and a very small quantity of
vegetables. From being a great water-drinker,
he had come down to an allowance of a bottle
or a bottle and a half of liquid in a day. When
thirsty he drank but little at a time; and between
meals, used to gargle his mouth with
fresh cold water.</p>

<p>A lady, residing in the town of Montereau,
wrote to me in the early part of September,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
1849. She was twenty-six years of age, and
weighed one hundred and seventy pounds.
Her corpulence was increasing to such an extent
that she would soon be unable to attend
to her household duties. She wished to know
if my system of treatment would interfere with
her general health, and whether it would prevent
her pursuing her usual and indispensable
daily avocations. On receiving the necessary
explanations, she immediately placed herself
under my care, and upon the 23rd of the same
month, she informed me that her weight was
already considerably less, but that her size
remained about the same. A letter of the 12th
October following states that she has lost fifteen
pounds weight, and that her size is materially
diminished. The treatment was continued
for some time longer, and never caused
the least interference with the discharge of her
domestic affairs.</p>

<p>In the course of the following year I received
a communication from Widow Rollin, of Versailles,
stating that she is the only support of a
large family, which necessitates great exertions
on her part: that a daily increasing corpulence
with most troublesome abdominal enlargement
gives rise to the most serious anxiety as to the
future. Provided no interruption in her daily
duties be required she would cheerfully submit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to my treatment. She wrote after seventeen
days trial of the system:&mdash;"My corpulence is
perceptibly diminished, and I am no longer
afflicted with drowsiness after meals. I follow
rigidly the instructions you have given me, and
each day feel more deeply indebted to you.
At the end of the month I shall do myself the
honour of calling upon you, as it is my wish to
continue under treatment until entirely freed
from my encumbrance. I can now walk with
ease, which was for a long time an impossibility.
The pain in the loins has likewise disappeared."</p>

<p>Mr. G. Chauvin, a lawyer, living at Castellane,
in the department of the Lower Alps,
owing to his increasing corpulency, was subject
to great inconvenience when speaking in court.
He adopted my mode of treatment, and in one
of his letters, dated November, 1851, he says:
"I have followed your directions, which have
effected the result I was led to expect. My
family have expressed their astonishment at
the sudden and extraordinary diminution of
size. But it has been effected without the
slightest bad symptom: the bodily functions
have been duly discharged, and the treatment
has been unattended with inconvenience or
danger, &amp;c."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame d'Aries, a resident of Bilbao, in
Spain, wife of the French Consul wrote to me
on the 12th of May last:&mdash;"Following your
directions, I have lost weight. Since my last
two confinements the abdomen had remained
unduly large: it is now much smaller. I feel
lighter. I have always been able to walk
without experiencing much fatigue. It was a
great trouble, however, to move from my seat.
A peculiar inward feeling, which was a source
of great annoyance, has become almost imperceptible.
I can go up stairs without bringing
on shortness of breath, and the benefit derived
is as evident to myself as it is visible to others."</p>

<p>On the 12th of April, 1851, I received a
letter from Mr. Roberts, of Tours, in which he
says:&mdash;"I am twenty-seven years of age, and
weigh two hundred and six pounds. I fear
that my great corpulence, which is constantly
on the increase, may prove exceedingly troublesome.
Having read your book, I am resolved
to give your method of treatment a fair
trial. You will oblige by giving me an explicit
and detailed statement as to what is necessary
to be done, and by sending from Paris such
medicines as may be necessary."</p>

<p>On the 22nd of the same month Mr. Roberts
wrote as follows:&mdash;"I weighed two hundred
and six pounds, and now weigh only one hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>dred
and ninety-two. I measured forty-three
inches in circumference, and now only thirty-one
inches. I am delighted with the success
which has attended your system of treatment,
and am happy to be able to inform you of it.
Accept my sincere thanks, for I am indebted to
you for a condition which I despaired of ever
again attaining. Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right smcap">"Roberts."</p>


<p class="p2">The following letter has been also received:</p>


<p class="p2 right">"<span class="smcap">Saint Di&eacute;</span>, 24th Nov., 1850.</p>


<p class="i2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Having read your book on the treatment
of obesity, I wish to ask if you will undertake
my case, although living at a distance
of three hundred miles from Paris. I am fifty
years of age, and possessed of a vigorous constitution.
Since I have retired from business,
now ten years ago, I have steadily increased in
corpulence; my present weight being one hundred
and eighty-nine pounds. I am troubled
with an affection of the heart, shortness of
breath, and my legs swell, especially when not
taking much exercise on foot. I am not fond
of walking, since it induces great fatigue. My
belly has become much enlarged, and I am
greatly troubled with drowsiness. For breakfast
I use coffee with milk, although I am not
fond of it, but I find that it prevents headache,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to which I am otherwise subject, &amp;c. You
will oblige me by sending the necessary instructions,
if you can take charge of my case,
by the bearer of this letter, together with such
medicines as you may direct.</p>

<p class="right">
"Yours, &amp;c.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; K."</p>


<p class="p2">In answer to Madame K., I sent her the
medicine, together with the necessary information.
On the 25th of February I received a
letter, from which the following extracts are
made:&mdash;"Your directions have been scrupulously
observed for the past fifteen days. I
take a daily walk in the mountains, and to-day
was weighed. I have lost but four pounds:
too small a reduction I fear; but perhaps due
partly to my temperament. The medicine
requires to be taken in larger doses, I think.
Nevertheless I am well satisfied with the result
thus far, being now free from those troublesome
palpitations of the heart to which I have
been hitherto subject."</p>

<p>The 9th of April following this lady wrote:
"My legs do not swell as they used to do, and
the palpitations have ceased. I am delighted
with this good result of your method of treatment."</p>

<p>Nothing more was heard of Madame K.
until the month of August in the following
year. She then writes that in accordance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the advice of the medical men of Saint Di&eacute;,
she, together with her family, went to take
the waters of Plombi&egrave;res. That on her return
her legs were again swollen, and that she suffered
from palpitation of the heart, which gave
rise to a choking sensation. She was desirous
of again undergoing the anti-obesic treatment.
On the 30th of September following she wrote
that she had followed my instructions during
the last three weeks, and had lost only four
pounds in weight; but added, I have obtained
a much more valuable result, and that is, the
almost total release from my troublesome heart
palpitation. I have not since heard from this
lady, but I have no doubt that she has been
once more cured of her palpitation, and that
she is no longer troubled with swellings of the
feet and legs. The loss of fat in this case has
been attended with freedom from palpitation
of the heart, from shortness of breath, and from
swelling of the lower extremities. What explanation
can be given as to the cause of these
results? As to her ailments, did they arise
from an excess of blood in the system, or was
she suffering from cardiac disease? Physicians
thought so and bled her, administered sedatives
and alteratives, and restricted the diet of the
patient. Still they did not cure her. On the
other hand I recommended her food should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
consist of meat principally; that she should be
allowed strong coffee and wine; which, together
with the employment of alkaline remedies,
reduced her fat and effected a cure. The following
season she goes, together with her
family, to the springs, and returns thence
afflicted in the same way as before, and again
my mode of treatment produces the same
result.</p>

<p>It is manifest that this heart affection, this
shortness of breath, depended upon obstruction
to the heart's action, and not upon any excess
of blood in the system, since I abstracted no
blood, but on the contrary, administered stimulants,
together with the use of full meat diet.
The swollen limbs arose no doubt from a partial
portal obstruction, and ceased when the
reduction of fat was effected. It may be urged
that the patient was better, or even cured, of
heart palpitation, before she had lost much in
weight. She had lost, however, four pounds;
and four pounds of fat occupy a large space.
The fat in a living body is fluid and very light.
A pound, therefore, is a large quantity. When
a person begins to lose his corpulency, the reduction
takes place first in the interior of the
body, and consequently there is a great improvement
during the first six or eight days in
the general health of obese patients, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
treated in accordance with the principles now
advocated.</p>

<p>An English lady wrote to me from Dieppe,
on the 15th of July, 1852. The following is
an extract from her letter:&mdash;"Arrived here
only a short time ago. I at once made trial of
your plan for the cure of obesity, and have
already experienced considerable improvement.
I have not yet had an opportunity of being
weighed, and therefore cannot assert positively
that my actual weight is less than it was, but
I certainly feel lighter, and my hands are
neither so red nor so fat as formerly."</p>

<p>Madame Meuriot, an actress, then staying
at Chatellerault, addressed me under date the
21st of August, 1851. Her letter is exceedingly
lengthy and full of minuti&aelig;aelig;, that would
be improper to lay before the public. But she
informs me that her weight in the course of a
single year had increased from one hundred
and twenty to one hundred and seventy-five
pounds. In order to retain her theatrical
engagements, she determined to use every possible
means to overcome this troublesome <i>embonpoint</i>.
She took her food in quantity barely
sufficient to sustain nature; made use of sea
biscuit instead of bread that she might eat less.
For some time past she has been taking daily
forty drops of the tincture of iodine, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
direction of a physician, but without appreciable
benefit. Every portion of the body was
loaded with fat, and the lower part of the legs
were swollen. Having met with my book and
dreading the effects of the iodine upon her
general health, she was anxious that I should
advise her. I did so; and sent the medicine,
together with necessary directions from Paris
to Perpignau, where she was then staying. I
received a letter from her on the 9th of October
following, in which she says:&mdash;"I am
happy to inform you that your treatment has
been attended with the most satisfactory
results. My legs are no longer swollen. I
walk with greater ease than formerly, and my
breathing is no longer oppressed. I am unable
to say how much my weight has decreased, not
having ready access to platform scales; but
my gowns tell me that my size is less than it
was, yet not as small as could be desired." In
conclusion she wished to know whether she
might continue the treatment a month or two
longer, and if I thought so, to please send her
the requisite medicine. I did so, and heard
nothing further from Madame de Meuriot until
the month of August in the following year.
She was then on her way to fulfil an engagement
at Lille, and called to see me. She expressed
great delight in having got rid of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
troublesome <i>embonpoint</i>, and said that she had
not been afflicted with swelling of the legs
since placing herself under my treatment.
"But something has occurred which I did not
in the least expect: since my corpulency has
left me, I have become <i>enceinte</i>."</p>

<p>A letter from this lady, dated Lille, the 13th
October last, begins thus:&mdash;"Since I last had
the pleasure of seeing you, on the occasion of
my departure from Paris, I have become fully
satisfied that I am in the family way, and have
been so for the past eight months." My advice
was requested on some points having
reference to her then condition.</p>

<p>The preceding facts tend to shew that reduced
corpulency is favourable to conception.</p>

<p>Towards the latter end of 1850, the wife of
Dr. Pecquet, of Paris, purchased my work on
Obesity. Having read it, she spoke to her
husband about it, who said that, like most
medical men, he was persuaded that the only
way to reduce corpulency, is to eat less than
the system demands.</p>

<p>Madame Pecquet, then about sixty years of
age, had long been troubled with excessive
corpulency, and weighed two hundred and
fifty pounds. She had, in consequence of this
affliction, passed the greater part of the last
eighteen years either in her arm-chair or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
bed. According to some of the most celebrated
physicians of Paris, and also of her
husband, her disease at one time was said to
be pulmonary catarrh&mdash;at another time, disease
of the heart&mdash;and again, something else;
till at length Madame Pecquet had no rest,
day or night.</p>

<p>If she attempted to go to sleep in the horizontal
position, she was immediately troubled
with a rush of blood to the head, accompanied
with the most distressing hallucinations, which
utterly prevented her from sleeping. She was
unable to take exercise on foot, even when her
ailments allowed her any respite, owing to the
excessive pain she experienced in the region
of the kidneys, and the abundant perspiration
of the head, which a walk of even a few steps
was sure to induce. It was consequently impossible
for her to go out, unless in a carriage.
Those only who are unable to enjoy this pleasure,
know how great a privation it is not to
be able to take a walk on a fine day, and how
wearisome it is to be compelled to make use of
a carriage in order to enjoy the advantages of
fresh air, or to move from place to place.</p>

<p>Madame Pecquet was so situated, and many
a time she has said,&mdash;"Eighteen long years
have I been in this condition! Eighteen years
of suffering and misery, in spite of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
medical aid which has been bestowed upon
me!" Under these circumstances, we can
readily understand how anxiously she must
have sought a means of cure. One day, without
the knowledge of her husband, she took a
carriage, and called to consult me.</p>

<p>Those who believe as I do, that an excessive
development of fat may induce and sustain a
generally diseased condition of body, will
readily admit that the diminution of excessive
obesity is the only rational means of cure in
such a case.</p>

<p>Impressed with this idea, Madame Pecquet
called upon me, and placed herself under my
care. I prescribed some medicine, which she
took without the knowledge of her husband,
who, although eating at the same table, did
not perceive that she partook of less vegetables
and ate a larger quantity of meat than usual.
Having continued the treatment four months,
Madame Pecquet said to her husband,&mdash;"I
have been following the anti-obesic treatment,
and weigh at the present time one hundred
pounds less than I did before commencing it.
Formerly I was confined to my arm-chair, in
consequence of catarrh or something else. I
could not walk fifty yards without stopping to
take breath; and now I can go out every day
if I please, when the weather is fine. Night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
formerly so wearisome, is now a season of
delightful and refreshing repose; and, in fine,
I have recovered my health, after eighteen
years of continued suffering."</p>

<p>I again met this lady last year, and found
her in the enjoyment of perfect health. She
had not regained her <i>embonpoint</i>, but was in
all respects perfectly happy, and gratefully
ascribed her recovery to my system of treatment.
On the recommendation of this patient,
Madame de M., in the month of June, 1852,
requested me to call upon her. She was between
thirty and thirty-five years of age, and
during the last eight years she had become
enormously fat. She was ailing, and had been
under treatment for almost every variety of
disease. Most of the medical men whom she
had consulted, owing to the pain she complained
of, ascribed her trouble either to organic
pulmonary lesion, to bronchial affection,
or to disease of the heart. She had tried
every means of cure. Had been under the
care of many of the principal physicians to
the hospitals of Paris, and also of professors of
the faculty. Deriving no advantage from these,
she had consulted hom&oelig;opathic practitioners,
and had been treated by them unavailingly.
In her despair, she had sought the advice of a
female clairvoyant; and in order that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
might obtain every possible benefit from the
treatment, had taken her into her own house&mdash;but
her sad condition was in no wise ameliorated.</p>

<p>Possessed of a naturally active and energetic
temperament, she was nevertheless compelled
to remain seated in an arm-chair, yet could not
lean back in it, owing to a sense of suffocation
which such a position was sure to induce.
When weary of this erect position, the only
relief she could obtain was by leaning upon
her left elbow, resting on the knee of the same
side. If she attempted to recline upon the
right side, she was subject to fits of coughing
and suffocation. Her days were passed in this
position: at night she was obliged to sit upright,
without any support to her back; and
when overcome with weariness, would fall forward
upon the left elbow, the only support she
could endure. Finally, however, in consequence
of the great and continued pressure of
the weight of the body, the elbow became inflamed,
an extensive sore formed upon it, and
a pad for the elbow became necessary. She
had scarcely any appetite, and had long since
given up the use of meat. She could walk a
little about her apartment, and although her
sister had lived for the last six years in the
house on the opposite side of the street, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
had not been able to visit her. Madame de M.
although by no means tall, weighed between
one hundred and eighty and one hundred and
ninety pounds. Under percussion the chest
proved resonant throughout, and air entered
freely the whole extent of the lungs. By the
aid of the stethoscope a r&acirc;le was heard in both
lungs. Beneath both clavicles there existed
scars, the result of blisters and cauteries. And
the whole surface of the chest and the pit of
the stomach were covered with the marks of
leech bites. There were no febrile symptoms.
Complexion blonde, with a remarkably fair
skin and large blue eyes, which seemed never
to have known pain. Under such circumstances
no organic lesion either of the lungs, the
bronchi, or of the heart could be suspected:
and I was satisfied that the great disturbance
of health in the case of this lady arose from
excessive obesity. Having placed herself under
my treatment, she experienced relief the first
week, and, at the end of a fortnight, Madame
de M. had perceptibly grown thinner. One
morning, when calling to see her, I was told
that she had gone for a ride to the Bois de
Boulogne, and that she had been out also the
day before, and was able to get in and out of
the carriage without assistance. She continued
to lose her <i>embonpoint</i> and her health became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
thoroughly re-established. She was able to lie
down in bed, and upon either side. At the
end of the month she visited friends whom she
had not called upon for the last six or eight
years, and six weeks or two months after commencing
my treatment, she danced repeatedly
at a ball given by her sister upon the occasion
of her recovery. Until then she had not worn
corsets for the last six years.</p>

<p>It was not until the month of October following,
that I again had occasion to see Madame
de M. Not feeling well, she sent for me. She
had caught cold the day before, when returning
late in the evening from the country, and was
slightly feverish. She was, however, quite well
again in a day or two. The last two years she
has enjoyed excellent health, although, like
most other ladies, she is occasionally subject to
trifling nervous attacks. In the enjoyment of
health and riches, she leads the fashionable life
of a gay young lady. How forcibly does her
present condition contrast with the previous
eight long years, passed in weariness and suffering!</p>

<p>In the month of June, 1852, Mr. Lucian Et&eacute;,
chief operator in the chemical works of Mr.
Christofle, silverer and gilder, Rue de Bondy,
sought my advice in reference to his corpulence,
which gave him much anxiety, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
feared that he would be obliged to give up
work. The sole support of a numerous family,
it required his utmost efforts to go through the
duties of the day. Obliged to be constantly
in motion, and frequently to go up and down
stairs, he suffered great pain in the kidneys,
and was often so much out of breath that it
was almost impossible for him to speak when
giving his orders or explanations. His head
was constantly bathed in perspiration; and if
he attempted to sit down for a moment, he was
immediately seized with an irresistible drowsiness.
He had been repeatedly bled and purged,
but without any salutary effect.</p>

<p>Lucian Et&eacute; followed my plan of treatment
for two months. During the first month he
lost from fifteen to twenty pounds of fat. I
do not recollect how much he lost in the second
month, but at the end of this time he was so far
reduced that further treatment was unnecessary.
Let it be observed, that during the two
months he was under treatment, he was not
absent a single day from his duties in the
factory.</p>

<p>I heard from Lucien d'Et&eacute; last year. He
was then in the enjoyment of perfect health,
and his corpulence had not returned.</p>

<p>Mons. Desrenaudes, living in the Rue du
Faubourg St. Honor&eacute;, became very corpulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in a comparatively short time. This was a
source of great inconvenience to him, from the
fact, that being much devoted to the pleasures
of the turf, his increased weight unfitted him
for the saddle. During the year 1852, he followed
my system of treatment for two months,
and obtained most satisfactory results, and, as
in every other case, without necessitating the
slightest interference with his daily avocations.</p>

<p>Madame d'Hervilly, residing in garrison at
Elb&oelig;uf, with her husband, a captain in the
2nd regiment of the line, having met with my
treatise on Obesity, came to Paris in order to
consult me. After her return to Elb&oelig;uf, she
adopted my system of treatment, and a fortnight
afterwards wrote as follows:</p>

<p>"6th July.&mdash;Your predictions have been
verified. I am now in excellent health, and
no longer suffer from the great oppression to
which I was formerly subject during hot weather.
Your medicine, according to my experience,
is everything that can be desired; but
I have been a sufferer for the last thirty years,
and it will take some time to effect a perfect
cure. I have not perceptibly diminished in
size, but am sensible of a peculiar freedom of
motion of the internal organs. My husband
also intends shortly to put your system in
practice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 11th August, this lady wrote again,
to say that she was still pursuing the treatment;
that she had not weighed herself, but
was then several inches less in circumference
than before.</p>

<p>The treatment was continued, and she became
thin. Her husband subsequently adopted
the system for a month, and derived great
advantage from it. I cannot say how much his
weight was diminished; but his great desire
was to get rid of an unsightly cushion of fat,
situated upon the back of his neck. I learn
from Madame d'Hervilly that this unmilitary-like
appendage has disappeared.</p>

<p>On the 7th August, 1852, M. Alcide Desbouillons
wrote to me from Brest, to the effect
that his corpulence was a source of great inconvenience;
that his duties required him to
be much on horseback, and consequently in
hot weather he suffered greatly from fatigue.
He weighed two hundred pounds, and measured
forty-nine inches in circumference. On
the 2nd September, after twenty days' trial of
my system, and, as he says, perhaps not as
rigorously carried out as it should have been,
he weighed himself again, and obtained the
following result: Weight, one hundred and
eighty-nine pounds: circumference, forty-five
inches. Twenty days after this he weighed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
one hundred and eighty-seven pounds, and
measured forty-three inches in circumference.
This was but a slight difference; yet M. Desbouillons,
after the first few days of treatment,
could walk with less difficulty, was more active,
and was no longer bathed in perspiration. In
his last letter he says, "I am continuing your
plan of treatment, and expect to find a notable
amelioration both in size and weight. The
effects produced by your medicine have been
in perfect accord with what you had led me to
expect. The experiment appears so far conclusive,
and I trust that my case will prove
thoroughly demonstrative."</p>

<p>If free from prejudice, and willing to acknowledge
the truth of that which is manifest,
the cases we have just cited ought to satisfy
any candid enquirer that obesity may be entirely
overcome without prejudicially affecting
the general health. At first sight, this would
appear undeniable; yet medical writers, who
have hitherto insisted that a meat diet is
conducive to the development of fat, and that
vegetables have an opposite tendency, will not
frankly acknowledge their error.</p>

<p>Physicians who have derived their knowledge
from books, and from the lectures of
their teachers, must find it difficult to change
their opinions in reference to obesity. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the public, when any one is told that the
imbibition of large quantities of water is productive
of fat, and that feeding upon animal
food induces leanness, a similar degree of
doubt is excited as when Galileo asserted
that the sun did not revolve around the earth.
On the publication of the first edition of my
treatise upon Obesity, I experienced a degree
of impatience, and even irritation, in view of
the systematic opposition which a self-evident
truth received at the hands of the medical
profession. At the present time, however, I
calmly recognize that the same happened in
the case of every attempted innovation. I call
to mind how Galileo endangered his very existence.
Vesalius, the founder of anatomy, was
saved from the stake only by the interference
of his sovereign. Harvey, the discoverer of
the circulation, was compelled to seek royal
protection from the attacks of the medical men
of his day. Peysonnel, a physician of Marseilles,
and a great naturalist, devoted himself
to the study of corals and madrepores. In
1727, he laid before the Academy of Science
a monogram, proving to demonstration that
corals and madrepores are structures due to
animal life; that what Dioscorides, Pliny,
Linn&aelig;us, Lamarck, Tournefort, &amp;c. &amp;c. had
thought to be flowers, are in truth animals;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and that these living creatures constructed and
augmented their abodes; the Academy, like
most learned bodies, admitted as truth only
that which it taught, and consequently paid
no attention to this memoir, which, nevertheless,
was destined to produce an entire change
in a large department of natural history.
When, long afterwards, Trembley published
his discoveries on fresh-water polypes, the studies
of Dr. Peysonnel in this direction were
remembered, and naturalists were forced to
admit that the physician of Marseilles was
right in maintaining that what had been taken
for flowers are in reality animals. His claim
as the discoverer of a fact which was destined
to effect an important revolution in an extensive
department of natural history, has since
then not been disputed, nor could it be. All
men, and men of science especially, require
time before yielding to evidence, when that
evidence is in opposition to preconceived
views, and interferes with personal interest.</p>

<p>The system I have introduced progresses,
and, as some might say, works wonders, and
effects cures in France, in England, in Belgium,
in Austria, in Russia, in Turkey, in
Africa; and in almost every instance, my
patients are persons occupying prominent positions&mdash;magistrates,
state authorities, general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
officers, or men of wealth, who have enjoyed
the advantages of a good education, and are
able to judge of and appreciate the merits of
my mode of treatment. The judgment of
such a tribunal should convince the incredulous.
This is no matter of faith. I lay claim
to the possession of no revelation, which is not
to be explained, or which is to rest solely upon
my assertion. I do not say that my discovery
is a mystery, and that it is your part to believe
in it. Under such circumstances, disbelief
would not astonish me, notwithstanding all
the cases of cure brought forward; but when
the nutrition of the body is explained in accordance
with the laws of nature, when it is shewn
to be in conformity with the well understood
laws of chemistry, and that facts are cited, in
reference both to man and the lower animals,
in support of these phenomena, I confess that
opposition to this system excites my astonishment.
Physicians cannot by any possibility
advance sufficient reasons against a system
which, when once explained, must appear self-evident
to every one.</p>

<p>Another fact in support of this system must
be submitted to my readers. What would a
medical man say if I should venture the following
piece of advice: You have a horse
you wish to dispose of. He is a good beast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and travels well, but he is thin. If he were
fatter, he would look better, and you could sell
him to greater advantage. Make him fat; and
if, in order to do this, I advised him to give
his horse a double allowance of oats, he would
only laugh at me. He would say; why, everybody
knows that if you wish to fatten a horse,
the best way is to give him, in addition to an
abundance of hay, bran, mixed with plenty of
water, or in other words, bran mashes; or the
horse may be sent to pasture, to live upon
grass, which is composed principally of water
and a small proportion of ligneous matter.
Under such circumstances, the horse will make
fat, and his form will become more round and
plump; but if, when he was thin, he was able
to travel thirty miles without sweating and
without fatigue, now that he is fat he will
scarcely be able to go five without being
covered with sweat, and without shewing manifest
signs of fatigue. When thin, he was a
good horse; but being fat, he has lost his best
qualities, which can be restored only by feeding
him again upon less bulky food, with a due
allowance of oats, and a small proportion of
water.</p>

<p>I have been informed that the gentleman in
charge of the stud of King Charles X. availed
himself of the knowledge of this fact, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
allowed only half the usual quantity of water
to the horses under his charge, and that this
plan was attended with the most satisfactory
results, the horses being thereby able to endure
a greater amount of fatigue than under a full
allowance of water.</p>

<p>To return to the cases of cure. Madam C.,
a landed proprietor, living in the Rue de la
Concorde, at Paris, went to take the waters in
Germany, in the year 1851. On her return,
she made trial of my system, on account of
excessive corpulence. Meeting with the usual
success, she thought it would be of great
advantage to a young lady, a friend, whom she
had left behind her at the watering place, and
who was then in bad health. This young person,
about twenty-three years of age, was very
fat, and irregular in her menstrual periods.
She was of lymphatic temperament, very pale,
and rarely partook of meat: her ordinary food
consisted of vegetables, sweetmeats, cakes and
sweet fruits; water was her principal beverage.
At the pressing instance of Madam C., Miss C.
visited Paris, in order to be under my care.
After following my directions for a fortnight,
her health was much improved. Her parents
then came to Paris, and I continued in attendance
on Miss C. for three months. At the
expiration of this time, she returned with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
parents to Brussels. She had lost much of her
fat, and had become regular. She ate meat
principally, both at breakfast and dinner, and
drank wine. I may lay claim, in the case of
this young lady, to have effected a complete
change of temperament. With but trifling
menstrual flow, and great pallor, she was gradually
progressing to a state of obesity, which
would have proved entirely destructive to
health, which would have ended in a total suppression
of the menses, and ultimately in death.
But now, having overcome her obesity, the
menstrual flow has become normal in quantity,
the digestive powers have resumed their functional
activity, so that she can partake of meat
and wine, and in every respect her constitution
is fully restored. Should she marry, she will
in all probability have a family, which would
have been very doubtful had she married while
in the previous obese condition; and if she
have children, her accouchements will be comparatively
free of danger, and her sufferings
much less; for it is well known that very corpulent
females have more difficult labours than
those of ordinary <i>embonpoint</i>; while the offspring
of the latter are at the same time healthier.
The same rule applies in the case of the
human female as with other mammalia; when
fat, conception is of more rare occurrence; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
when they do conceive, they are very liable to
miscarry. When, however, they go to the full
period of gestation, the progeny of a very fat
mother is almost always lean, and possesses
little vitality. Moreover, the milk of a very
fat mother is neither so abundant nor so nutritious
as that of a moderately thin mother.</p>

<p>M. Albert C. was an officer in the 4th Hussar
regiment. He became so corpulent that he
wished to exchange into the gendarmery. In
1852, he was appointed lieutenant in this
branch of the service. His new position, however,
still required him to be much on horseback;
and when required to travel any distance,
and to trot for a short time, he suffered
much from difficulty of breathing, and complained
of a sense of oppression in the region
of the heart. It seemed as though the heart
had not sufficient space for the execution of its
movements. Feeling naturally anxious about
his health, he wrote to me desiring to place
himself under my care. Impressed with the
idea that his trouble was consequent upon his
excessive corpulence, I gave him advice, which
he followed for several weeks; but in consequence
of a severe wound in the leg, which
obliged him to keep his bed, and undergo a
surgical operation, he left off my plan of treatment.
Some time afterwards, he fell sick; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was bled, leeched, &amp;c., and partially recovered
his health; but the heart affection became exceedingly
troublesome, especially when on
horseback. His physician advised him to return
to Paris. On his arrival, he resumed my
system of treatment, and after a fortnight experienced
great relief; his appetite had improved,
he slept well, and the pain which he
had suffered in the region of the heart disappeared.
When he came to Paris, he was
scarcely able to walk, but at the end of fifteen
days he could walk all over the city. His
health became thoroughly re-established on
the loss of his obesity, and he was enabled to
resume his military duties.</p>

<p>On the 18th of February, 1853, I received a
letter from Mr. L., superintendent of a royal
factory at Annecy, in Savoy, in which he says:
"You were kind enough to send on the 20th
of April, 1851, medicine sufficient for two
months of anti-obesic treatment. Your directions
were scrupulously attended to during the
first month, and I experienced considerable
benefit&mdash;in fact I lost nine pounds in weight,
and felt more active and much more fit for
business. Circumstances prevented my continuing
the treatment during the second month
and the medicine has been lost. After the
lapse of two years I am anxious to resume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
your plan of treatment, &amp;c." It is now a year
since Mr. L. wrote to me, when I sent him all
that was requisite. I have not since heard
from him by letter, but I know that the second
treatment was equally satisfactory. Owing to
his favorable report of my system, a notary of
Annecy, during the course of last summer,
sought my advice. I am also indebted to him
for other patients.</p>

<p>In the month of June, 1853, Madame de L.,
of Amiens, consulted me on her own behalf,
and also on that of her husband&mdash;both labouring
under obesity. I gave her the necessary
directions, together with medicine sufficient to
last two months. She wrote to me on the 2nd
of July in the following terms:</p>

<p class="p2 i2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In fulfilment of my promise, I send
you a statement of the result of your treatment.
My husband has lost eleven pounds in
weight, and enjoys excellent health. As for
myself, owing to severe indisposition after my
return home from Paris, I have only adopted
your treatment during the last eight days.
Please inform me whether the medicine you
furnished to me a month ago is too old to be
of any service.</p>

I answered this letter, and no doubt the lady
has derived as much benefit as her husband
from the treatment.</p>


<p class="right p2">
"<span class="smcap">Nismes</span> (<span class="smcap">Gard</span>) 4th Aug., 1853.</p>

<p class="i2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have read with much interest the
second edition of your precepts, based upon
chemistry, for the diminution of obesity, and
have carefully examined every statement you
have so clearly set forth. The result is, that I
am anxious to follow your advice, and to place
myself under your course of treatment. I am
a doctor of philosophy and professor in the
Imperial Lyceum at Nismes. During my
whole life I have struggled against this terrible
obesity, but almost always in vain. Nevertheless
I have succeeded upon two occasions: the
first, about twenty years ago, by travelling on
foot for three months among the forests and
mountains of the north of Europe; the second
time, about twelve years ago, by dint of continued
and intense intellectual labour. Owing
to the sedentary nature of my duties, obesity
has since returned in a more threatening manner,
and is no doubt the exciting cause of many
ailments to which I am now subject, such as
accumulation of mucus in the air passages,
giving rise to cough, more especially troublesome
because I am obliged to talk during the
greater part of the day; cold feet, with swel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>ling
of the legs and ankles, &amp;c., so that I am
no longer able to perform the duties upon
which my daily bread depends. My medical
attendant can do nothing for me. He has
prescribed purgatives and a vegetable diet,
without any good result. I have taken thousands
of Morrison's pills, and am worse rather
than better, and now my mind is made up to
make a trial of your plan of treatment, in full
confidence that a cure may yet be accomplished.</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Doctor Halberg</span>,<br />
"Professor at the Imperial Lyceum of Nismes."</p>


<p class="p2">On the 8th of June Dr. Halberg wrote:</p>


<p class="p2 i2">"I find myself infinitely better, my breathing
is easy, and I am considerably reduced in
size. My great desire is that the swelling in
my legs may wholly disappear.</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Dr. Halberg.</span>"</p>


<p class="p2">Towards the latter end of 1851, Madame
Wimy, from the town of Marle, came to consult
me in reference to her husband, who was
labouring under obesity to such a degree as to
be unable to attend to his business. I gave
her the necessary advice, together with some
medicine. On the 19th of December Madame
Wimy told me by letter that her husband had
already much improved, that his breathing
was easier, he was more capable of exertion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and that his corpulence had notably diminished.
This lady again wrote to me in the following
year, requesting a further supply of medicine.
She said:&mdash;"My husband, before commencing
your treatment, weighed two hundred and
seventy pounds: he now weighs only two hundred,
and hopes to weigh still less. You are
no doubt in the frequent receipt of letters
seeking advice, for we have many inquiries
for your address."</p>

<p>In truth the case of M. Wimy has brought
me a great many patients. Anxious to know
whether he still continued my plan of treatment,
and wishing to introduce a statement of
his case in this the third edition of my work, I
wrote to M. Wimy on the 16th of October last
and received the following reply:</p>


<p class="p2 right">
"<span class="smcap">Marle</span>, 19th Oct., 1853.</p>

<p class="i2">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In your letter of the 16th, you requested
me to give a somewhat detailed statement
of my case. I commenced the treatment
under your directions, the latter part of 1851,
and continued it during the early part of 1852.
My weight was two hundred and seventy
pounds, and I measured sixty-one inches in
circumference. I walked with great difficulty&mdash;suffered
much pain in the kidneys&mdash;my legs
were swollen. I had a constant cough, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was much troubled with drowsiness. Immediately
after adopting your system, my fat
began to disappear, my appetite improved,
and, after a few months, my weight was reduced
to one hundred and sixty pounds, and
my circumference to thirty-two inches. My
health is now excellent. Being landlord of
the Golden Lion Hotel, at Marle, where the
stages put up, my recovery is known to a
great many; and travellers who stopped at
my house two years ago, when I was labouring
under obesity, on seeing me at present,
and noticing the wonderful change which has
taken place, invariably ask by what means it
has been effected.</p>

<p class="i2">"It always affords me great pleasure to acknowledge
that my cure is due to your system
of treatment.</p>

<p class="right">
"I have the honour to be, &amp;c.,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Jules Wimy</span>.</p>
<p class="i2">
"Golden Lion Hotel,<br />
Marle, Aisne."</p>


<p class="p2">A person who visited Marle about four
months ago, and who had not seen M. Wimy
since the great change had been effected in his
appearance, was much astonished, and made
inquiries respecting the cure. Some time afterwards,
this person met, at Orleans, a wealthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
gentleman, about forty years of age, suffering
from obesity, and told him what he had witnessed
at Marle; recommending him at the
same time to visit Paris, in order that he
might have the advice of the doctor who had
freed Wimy from his excessive fat. This
gentleman wrote to Marle, before coming to
Paris, and received a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>He called to consult with me, saying that
he wished to place himself under my care,
provided that it would not interfere with his
business or with his usual habits. He is postmaster
at Orleans, and, previous to the building
of the railroad, had a great deal of business
to attend to. Having many more horses than
necessary for his business at Orleans, he has
opened a livery stable in Paris. He is consequently
obliged to attend all the fairs and
markets, in order to purchase horses and provender
for his two establishments,&mdash;the one at
Paris and the other at Orleans, and is almost
constantly travelling between these two cities,
and therefore leads a life of great activity.
He weighs two hundred and twenty-two
pounds, and wishes to lose fifty pounds of fat,
but he cannot afford to lose a day from his
business.</p>

<p>My reply to Mr. M. was, that so far from
my treatment demanding any cessation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
work, it would rather give him strength to
carry it on. He began the treatment ten
weeks since, and has already lost between
twenty-eight and thirty pounds of fat; and,
as I had promised, without causing him the
loss of a single day.</p>

<p>It is said, that in order to be understood and
believed, it is necessary to repeat the same
thing over and over again. But all things
must have an end; and all the cases which I
might yet report, would still end in diminution
of obesity. It may be said, however,
that, like most medical writers, I report
only favourable cases, and conceal those which
are unfavourable. My answer is, that I have
never treated a single case in which a favourable
result has not been obtained, provided
the patient has observed my directions for
even eight days; and I am satisfied that if any
one could be found to say that he has not been
benefited, that it would be because he has not
been willing to carry out the treatment for
even eight days. It has no doubt frequently
happened that a patient has consulted me, and
has then followed my directions for two, three,
or even four days, and then, for some cause,
has given them up: under these circumstances
it might be said that no benefit has been derived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Many such cases have occurred. In one instance,
a wealthy man, a gold-beater by trade,
living in Paris, sought my advice. He followed
my system for several weeks, without
success. One day I said to him, "I can only
explain your want of success by attributing it
to excessive drinking. You live upon meat
principally, it is true; but how much liquid
do you imbibe daily?" His answer was,&mdash;"I
cannot abstain from drinking when thirsty,
and my thirst is frequent. I spend the whole
day in the factory, among fifteen or twenty
workmen, and the heat is necessarily great,
as the nature of our manufacture demands it,
and I am therefore obliged to drink a great
deal." I consequently recommended him to abstain
from further trial of a system which,
under these circumstances, could not possibly
be of any benefit.</p>

<p>We meet with people who make, or seem to
make, a resolution to live according to a certain
plan, for eight or ten days, and who, like
spoiled children, forget the very next day the
resolution they had made. I have met with
many such cases. One would scarcely believe
that a lady, reduced to despair on account of
her obesity, and threatening to commit suicide
unless relieved of her <i>embonpoint</i>, could promise
that she would obey my instructions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
live chiefly upon a meat diet, and to abstain
from inordinate quantities of fluid, yet the
very next day would resume her customary
mode of living;&mdash;breakfasting upon eggs, preserves,
and two or three cups of sweetened
tea; and dine upon rich pastry and sweetmeats,
accompanied with a full allowance of
champagne. I could not have believed it
possible had I not witnessed it myself.</p>

<p>Men generally carry out my directions more
faithfully than women, being firmer and more
persevering in their resolves.</p>

<p>I am almost angry at times with this want
of perseverance in persons who boast that they
have carried out my treatment without success.
It would be an easy matter to shew
that the want of success in such cases is entirely
their own fault.</p>

<p>A young lady of one of the most illustrious
families of France, and married to a wealthy
foreign nobleman, consulted me in the month
of May, 1853, in reference to her corpulence.
She told me that her cousin, the Duchess of X.,
had derived great benefit from my treatment;
and from what she had witnessed in her case,
she was induced to place herself under my
care. She promised to commence my system
on the following day.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards I saw her. She told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
me she had forgotten to take her medicine the
day before. In subsequent visits, she confessed
that she had not taken any medicine,
either because she had been up very late the
previous evening and had laid in bed late that
morning, or that she had been spending a day
or two in the country; or that, having been
out for an early ride, she had forgotten all
about it. On the occasion of my last visit,
she told me that she was going for some time
to her country-seat, and from thence intended
to visit a watering-place. The Baroness did
not follow my treatment for three days consecutively,
and consequently lost nothing of
her <i>embonpoint</i>. Under such circumstances,
want of success ought surely not to be attributed
to inefficacy of the treatment.</p>

<p>A very corpulent professor adopted my
system for eight days, and lost three pounds
and a half in weight. Being relieved at the
same time from a sense of oppression which
had continually troubled him, he was delighted,
and spoke of the happy results to
many of his acquaintances. Unfortunately
at this time he received from the country a
present of a large basket of grapes, and being
very partial to them, neglected my instructions,
and partook of them inordinately as long
as they lasted. The consequence is, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
professor is as fat as ever, although he had
followed my plan of treatment for eight days.
Now whose fault is this? Nevertheless, his
acquaintances, to whom he had spoken of
being under my care, will attribute the failure
to me. I shall see him again, no doubt, some
of these days, when in danger of suffocation.</p>

<p>The reader who has perused the preceding
cases of cure, may say that I have omitted to
speak of obesity accompanied with skin disease,
and in my introduction mention has been
made of its frequency. In truth, many such
cases have been met with; but skin disease,
in my opinion, is of such a nature that it is
better not to give a hint even of the parties in
whom it has been met with and cured at the
same time with co-existing corpulence.</p>

<p>My method of reducing obesity being thus
frankly explained, is perhaps likely to lose its
value in the eyes of many, owing to its extreme
simplicity. M. Desbouillons, of Brest,
a patient whom I successfully treated, wrote
to me on the 15th August, 1853:&mdash;"On reading
your treatise a second time, I cannot but
express my astonishment that the medical
faculty should so long have failed to discover
the means which you now so successfully employ
for the cure of obesity."</p>

<p>Having accomplished the object I had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
view, it matters not whether it be the result of
little study or of long and deep enquiry into
the secrets of animated nature; my satisfaction
consists in having destroyed those false
and prejudicial doctrines which had existed
for ages in the writings and teachings of philosophers,
and in having demonstrated a truth
destined to render important services to our
common humanity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="medium">ON THE SELECTION OF ALIMENTARY SUBSTANCES
FAVOURABLE TO THE REDUCTION
OF CORPULENCE.</span></h2></div>


<p>It is to be borne in mind, that in dividing
alimentary matter into two kinds&mdash;one fitted
to develop fat, and the other having an opposite
tendency&mdash;my object is merely to suit the
indispensable requirements of my plan of treatment.
Nor is the conclusion to be drawn, that
in order to diminish corpulence, an exclusive
meat diet is absolutely necessary. Man is omnivorous;
that is to say, he partakes of everything
entering into the composition of ordinary
alimentation; but, for the purposes of my
system, azotized substances should constitute,
though not exclusively, his principal food.</p>

<p>Large quantities both of animal and vegetable
substances compose the ordinary diet of
man. According to some philosophers, man
should live on flesh only; while others maintain
that man is by nature a vegetable feeder.
Most naturalists, however, are agreed that the
human species is omnivorous; that is to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
can live both upon vegetable and animal matter.
A certain proof, in my opinion, that such
is the case, is to be found in the fact that man
is provided with the two kinds of teeth, the
one appertaining especially to carnivorous, and
the other to herbivorous animals.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that man, in his present
state of civilization, does not instinctively
recognize the kind of food which is beneficial
or prejudicial to his well-being. Experience
alone teaches him what is good or bad. With
the lower animals it is otherwise; they have
the power to discern that which is suitable
for food. The colt and the kid know how to
select, among the varied herbage, the particular
grasses which are suitable to their organization.
Domesticated animals, having but an
insufficiency of food, do sometimes partake of
noxious plants. It may be that man, in consequence
of his civilization, has lost that instinct
possessed by the lower animals, and in blind
confidence partakes of everything which is
served to him in the shape of food; and this
view derives support from the fact, that savages,
and people but partially civilized, refuse
to eat anything they are unacquainted with, no
matter how temptingly it may be prepared.</p>

<p>The uneducated peasantry of France, at this
day, will not taste food to which they are un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>accustomed,
or if they do, it is only with great
mistrust.</p>

<p>It is matter of daily experience, that man
can simultaneously feed upon both vegetable
and animal matter, and can also live when
restricted to one of these alone; such restriction,
however, being better borne under the
varied conditions of age, season and climate.</p>

<p>From these considerations it follows that, for
the accomplishment of a given purpose, man
has the privilege of selecting certain alimentary
substances, and of refusing many others;
the health of the individual, who may thus
submit to the diet of his choice, being in no
wise affected thereby.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the well established principles
of physiology and chemistry, together with
the precepts set forth in the preceding pages,
we may be safely guided in the selection of
such alimentary substances as will conduce to
the fixity of a certain condition of <i>embonpoint</i>,
although having a tendency to redundancy;
or which, on the other hand, will insure a
diminution of obesity. Such results can be
obtained by paying attention to the following
remarks:</p>

<p>That kind of meat known as game is very
nutritious, occupies but small space, and consequently
only moderately distends the alimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>tary
canal. It contains but a small amount
of carbon, relatively to the other compounds,
and therefore should be used as much as possible:
such as venison, hare, the warren rabbit,
woodcock, snipe, partridge, quail, plover, wild
duck, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The fluid portion of all ragouts should be
avoided by those who dread corpulence, and
game should therefore be roasted rather than
stewed. The same may be said of butcher's
meat, such as surloin of beef, beefsteak, veal
cutlet, mutton chop, fresh pork, leg of mutton,
&amp;c. Gelatinous dishes, such as calves' feet
and tripe, should be avoided. Poultry, when
roasted, is not contra-indicated.</p>

<p>It is a matter of observation, that those
races which live chiefly upon fish are gross and
dull, pale and lymphatic, and less courageous
than such as live upon flesh. A fish diet is
consequently favourable to the development of
fat, and the usual accompaniment of butter
sauce is also productive of a like result.</p>

<p>The anti-obesic treatment, therefore, requires
that fish should be partaken of sparingly;
still it has been remarked that patients, while
undergoing treatment, who eat principally of
meat, with a very small amount of fish, do
nevertheless succeed in the accomplishment of
the object they have in view. The most nutri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>tious
fish are turbot, trout, sole, salmon, perch,
pike, tench and carp. On the other hand, shell
fish, such as oysters, lobsters, crabs and shrimps,
have a tendency to impede the formation of fat.</p>

<p>Vegetables, such as lettuce, chicory, sorel,
artichokes, spinach, green pease, beans, cabbage,
celery, and all such as are used by way
of salad, are not very nutritive, but contain
much watery and mucilaginous matter, favourable
to the development of corpulency: the
same may be said of carrots, turnips, potatoes,
rice, beet-root, maccaroni and vermicelli bread;
all kinds of cakes, pastry and biscuits, which
are made of wheaten flour, are decidedly contra-indicated,
as are also eggs, cream, cheese
and butter.</p>

<p>In reference to chocolate, much difference of
opinion has hitherto existed as to its nutritious
properties; but we know by experience that it
is easy of digestion, and eminently suited to
such as are subject to great mental exertion.
Some dietists have held that chocolate has a
tendency to prevent any augmentation of corpulency.
When made with water, it is decidedly
preferable to coffee made with milk, the
latter being productive of fat. Milk, by virtue
of its composition, combines all the elements
which are fitted for the development and nutrition
of the body; casein containing nitrogen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a fatty matter (butter), and a saccharine substance
(sugar of milk).</p>

<p>Chemistry reveals the remarkable fact, that
the composition of casein or the cheesy portion
of milk, is identical with that of the fibrin
and albumen of the blood. Under this aspect,
therefore, milk is very nutritious.</p>

<p>The sugar and butter which exist in milk,
have no analogy with flesh; according to analysis,
they are composed of carbon and the elements
of water. When, therefore, we partake
of milk, we obtain in one and the same substance
all the elements which are necessary for
the growth and nutrition of the body, and such
is the case in infant life. Since, however, both
carbon and hydrogen, in very large proportion,
enter into the composition of milk, it is advisable,
whenever there is a manifest tendency to
corpulence, that the use of it as an article of
diet should be avoided. Infants are usually
fat, owing to the elements of adipose matter
forming so large a proportion of their food,
whether that consist of milk alone, or in combination
with starchy or farinaceous and saccharine
substances.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2></div>


<p>With few exceptions, the corpulent, both
male and female, drink a great deal with their
meals; and I am more and more convinced,
by daily experience, that the large amount of
fluid thus imbibed has powerfully contributed
to produce their present condition. It may
be said that it is constitutional with them to
require so much drink. I grant that many
persons are in the habit of drinking a great
deal more than others, and even that they are
constitutionally so inclined; but I cannot allow
that they are compelled to drink as much as
they do. Habit exercises a powerful influence
over all our actions; and I have no doubt that,
notwithstanding the existence of a natural predisposition
to drink a great deal at meal time,
the inclination might be held in check, by not
yielding too easily to the desire. Many people,
without thinking, increase and stimulate their
thirst by making use of highly seasoned dishes;
it would be well that they should exercise caution
in this respect. Even when using a moderate
amount of beverage, a selection as to kind
is necessary. Beer and cider being especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
rich in aqueous and mucilaginous matter, are
by virtue of these elements particularly prone
to the production of corpulence. All kinds
of drink, when taken in excess, act rather as
depressants than stimulants of the nervous
centres, and a want of physical and mental
activity, alike predisposes to obesity.</p>

<p>Alcoholic drinks of every kind tend to the
development of fat, owing to the large amount
of the carbonaceous element they contain.
Men who use brandy in excess are frequently
so puffy and soft that you can scarcely discover
the presence of muscular tissue beneath
the skin. When blood is abstracted from
such persons, it is found to be thin, and to
contain a less amount of the most important
of the sanguineous elements. We must not
deceive ourselves; fat is not to be taken always
as an evidence of strength, but, on the
contrary, should be regarded as indicative of
want of tone and of vital power, as in the
case of the aged, who are frequently corpulent
though infirm; young chlorotic females;
persons deprived of a due supply of fresh air;
and such as make use of an excessive amount
of alcoholic drink. With respect to the last,
it may be said, perhaps, that some are to be
met with who, far from being corpulent, are
excessively thin, in consequence of drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
large quantities of brandy; and such is indeed
sometimes the case, but it is due to the fact that
some essential organ of the body is suffering
under the pernicious influence. And although
the person may have been, at a former period,
fat and lusty, the body finally becomes wearied
with this continued excess, the stomach is diseased,
nutrition is impeded or wholly suspended,
and a complete destruction of the vital
organism results.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be believed, yet it is nevertheless
true, that females can bear these excesses
for a longer period than men, and that
when they do unfortunately yield to them,
they indulge to even a greater extent.</p>

<p>Observation and experience fully corroborate
the assertion. Among a great number of
cases that could be cited, one must suffice.
A young lady, a creole, living in Paris, was in
the habit of taking daily a pint of brandy,
without its producing any disturbance of her
faculties, and, it might be almost said, without
committing any excess. When she took a
larger quantity,&mdash;which indeed was often the
case,&mdash;she became loquacious and troublesome
to her attendants: complained of headache
and hallucinations, which deprived her of
sleep, and said that she dreaded an attack of
apoplexy. During four or five years of pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>fessional
attendance upon her, I have been
witness to several of these fits of excess. She
rarely or ever walked, but made use of her
carriage, rose late, and seldom partook of
meat unless strongly seasoned with red pepper.
She became excessively obese under this system
of living, and when I lost sight of her she was
an utter deformity. Her complexion, however,
was still good, and I could attribute her
obesity only to her extreme intemperance.</p>

<p>Water is the natural beverage of man; but
being no longer in a state of nature, that
which was at first destined to assuage his
thirst, is not found to be in accordance with
his changed habit,&mdash;his altered mode of life
consequent upon civilization. To the water a
small quantity of wine may be advantageously
added, producing a tonic and slightly stimulating
drink, suitable to such stomachs as may
stand in need of it as an adjunct to digestion.</p>

<p>Pure wine is not suitable for ordinary beverage,
but will rather excite thirst than allay
it, and at the same time may induce irritation,
or even inflammation of the stomach. Those
only who use a great deal of exercise in the
open air can tolerate pure wine with impunity.</p>

<p>Many of the white wines produce a diuretic
effect, and are less apt to induce corpulence
than the red wines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Champagne is certainly most agreeable to
the palate, and on account of its stimulating
effect, even when taken in small quantity, is
much in vogue; yet it is not suited to such as
have a tendency to make fat. A young lady
under my care, who was enormously fat, acknowledged
that she lived exclusively on
pastry and sweetmeats, and drank nothing but
champagne. A change both of food and beverage
effected a speedy cure. In some cases
this wine gives rise to indigestion, owing to
the large amount of free carbonic acid gas
which it contains, acting injuriously upon the
nerves which are distributed to the stomach.</p>

<p>A strong infusion of tea is one of those
beverages having a tendency to oppose the
formation of fat; it is nevertheless nutritious,
inasmuch as it prevents the disintegration of
tissue. Moreover, its action on the nervous
system is exhilarating. On account of these
properties it is much used in England by all
classes. A weak infusion of tea, with a superabundance
of milk and sugar, is, on the
other hand, highly conducive to the formation
of fat, and therefore should be avoided.</p>

<p>The beneficial effects of tea and coffee are
due to substances heretofore named "<i>theine</i>"
and "<i>caffeine</i>," according to the source whence
they were obtained. These substances are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
now known to be identical, although derived
from plants of entirely different families. An
infusion of coffee produces effects similar to
those induced by tea. If weak, it is favourable
to the development of corpulence; but if
strong, it acts as a powerful stimulant upon
the nervous system, and assists digestion. A
very strong infusion of coffee, more particularly
when taken upon an empty stomach, is
powerfully anti-obesic in its effects.</p>

<p>It has been alleged that coffee must be nutritious,
because labourers are enabled to support
life upon a small amount of solid food
when supplied with an abundance of coffee.
Now the fact is, that coffee has all the properties
of tea, and, like it, prevents waste of
tissue, thereby economizing food to the utmost,
and enabling the labourer to do a large
amount of bodily work with a comparatively
slight expenditure of the organized tissues of
the living body.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
