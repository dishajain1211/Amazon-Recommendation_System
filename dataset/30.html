<h2>Note</h2>

<p>The current, popular spelling of Persian Names and Words
has been generally adopted in the following pages, in order to
avoid any appearance of pedantry. The <i>Turkish</i> forms have
occasionally been preferred when in place, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Devlet</i> for
<i>Daulat</i>, and <i>Mevlānā</i> for <i>Maulānā</i>. The exact
transliteration of the Persian&mdash;such as Jalálu-'d-Din, Shams-ud-Din,
Umar, <span class="uline">Gh</span>asal, Díwán&mdash;will be found in the foot-note references to more
learned Works.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeláleddín Rúmí</span> (<small>A.D.</small> 1207-1273) is now universally recognised
by 'those who know,' as the greatest of the Persian
Mystical Poets. This supremacy, in his own sphere, has been
unanimously accorded to him for more than six centuries, by
unnumbered myriads of his own disciples and followers in the
Oriental World, who have been wrapt in devoutest admiration
of the great Master to whom they have owed the highest joy
and inspiration of their spiritual life. And at last, in our own
Western World, the great Persian scholars of Europe, looking
at him without personal or national bias, and through the clear,
cold light of the new time, have come more and more, as with
one voice, to join in this chorus of praise. His most appreciative
recent editor and interpreter in England, in presenting a
few leaves plucked with reverent hand from what he calls
Jeláleddín's 'wreath of imperishable Lyric Song,' offers his own
careful and conscientious work to us, as a contribution 'to a
better appreciation of <i>the greatest mystical poet of any age</i>.' And
with this designation, as summing up the judgment of a capable
expert and critic&mdash;strange as it may sound&mdash;we venture, in all
deference and sincerity, to agree. Jeláleddín is now rising upon
our literary horizon in all his native Splendour&mdash;his name appropriately
signifying 'The Splendour of the Faith'&mdash;as at once the
Dante, the St. Bernard, the Spenser, the Milton, the Angelus
Silesius, and the Novalis of the Orient. As a religious Lyrical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">{xii}</a></span>
Poet his mellifluous music, his variety of strain, his captivating
charm of words, his purity of feeling, his joyous faith, and his
elevation of thought, have never been surpassed in their own
kind. Taking what Matthew Arnold has called 'the lyrical
cry' even in its widest range, it would be doing no one wrong&mdash;although
it dare hardly be done as yet&mdash;to rank Jeláleddín,
when he comes fully before us 'with all his singing robes about
him,' with the very highest&mdash;with Shakespeare, with Wordsworth
and Keats and Shelley, and with Goethe and Heine!
He is certainly one of the most fertile poets of Nature among
the Lyrical Singers of all time, and the most exuberant, if not
also the most spiritual, Hymnist the world outside of Christendom
has yet produced.</p>

<p>This estimate, however shaded or qualified, cannot but
appear at first strangely exaggerated, and out of all just
proportion, to those who mayhap read the name of Jeláleddín
now for the first time. Let us listen, then, to the greatest
students of Persian Poetry in the critical Nineteenth Century,
the judges who have highest authority on the subject, and who
have the best right to pronounce judgment on Jeláleddín. And
let us hear in the first place, as is his due, the most learned
Historian of Persian Poetry in the Nineteenth Century, who
with indefatigable industry and completest knowledge has
adorned his pages with Extracts from no less than Two
Hundred of Persia's greatest Poets. Joseph von Hammer, the
great Austrian Orientalist (known later as Baron Von Hammer-Purgstall
and as the Historian of Arabic Literature in seven
immense volumes, containing Accounts of nearly ten thousand
Authors) says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lmargin">

 <p class="small">'Jeláleddín Rumi is the greatest Mystical Poet of the East, the Oracle
 of the Sofis, the Nightingale of the contemplative life, the Author of
 the Mesnevi (a celebrated double-rhymed ascetic poem), and the Founder
 of the Mevlevi, the most famous Order of Mystical Dervishes. As Founder
 of this Order, as the Legislator of the Contemplative Life, and as the
 Interpreter of Heavenly Mysteries, he is highly revered. And as such he
 has to be estimated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span>
 by quite a different standard from that which applies to those Poets
 whose inspiration has not soared, like his, to the Vision of Divine
 things, to the primal Fountain of Love and Light. He cannot properly be
 compared either with Firdusi, the greatest of the Persian Epic Poets,
 nor with Nizami, the greatest of the Romantic Poets, nor with Saadi,
 the first of the moral Didactic Poets, nor with Hafiz, the chiefest of
 the erotic Lyrical Poets; for all these won the Palm of Poetry in
 entirely different fields from his. The only two great Poets of his
 kind, with whom a comparison can be in place, Senayi, the Author of the
 Mystical 'Flower Garden,' and Attar, the Author of the Mystical 'Bird
 Dialogues.' But both these works stand, as regards poetic merit, far
 below the Mesnevi, which is the Text Book of all The Sofis, from the
 banks of the Ganges to the shores of the Bosphorus. The Collection of
 Jeláleddín's 'Lyrical Poems'&mdash;his <span class="smcap">Divan</span>, properly so
 called&mdash;'is regarded by them as of still higher value; it is
 practically the Law Book and the Ritual of all these Mystics. These
 outbursts of the highest inspiration of its kind deserve to be more
 closely considered, as it is from them that we see shining forth as in
 clear splendour the essence of the Oriental Mysticism, the cardinal
 Doctrine that All is One&mdash;the view of the ultimate Unity of all
 Being&mdash;and giving with it Direction and Guidance to the highest goal of
 Perfection by the contemplative Way of Divine Love. On the wings of the
 highest religious enthusiasm, the Sofi, rising above all the outward
 forms of positive Religions, adores the Eternal Being, in the
 completest abstraction from all that is sensuous and earthly, as the
 purest Source of Eternal Light. Mevláná Jeláleddín thus soars, not only
 like other Lyrical Poets, such as Hafiz, over Suns and Moons, but even
 above Space and Time, above the world of Creation and Fate, above the
 Original Contract of Predestination, and beyond the Last Judgment, into
 the Infinite, where in Eternal Adoration he melts into One with the
 Eternal Being, and infinitely loving, becomes One with the Infinite
 Love&mdash;ever forgetting himself and having only the great All in his
 view.'<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span>
Thus far the learned Von Hammer. But let us also hear the
judgment of the East itself, of which this is only a Western
echo, as it may be gathered from Devletshah, the greatest
native biographer&mdash;the Dr. Johnson we may appropriately say&mdash;of
the Persian Poets. Of Jeláleddín, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lmargin">

 <p class="small">'His pure Heart is filled with Divine Mysteries, and through his
 eradiating Soul streams the Infinite Light. His View of the World leads
 the thirsty in the Vale of the Contemplative Life to the refreshing
 Fountain of Knowledge; and his Guidance leads those who have wandered
 in the Wilderness of Ignorance into the Gardens where Truth is really
 known. He makes plain to the Pilgrim the Secrets of the Way of Unity,
 and unveils the Mysteries of the Path of Eternal Truth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse small">As when the foaming Sea high swells in Wave upon Wave,</div>
<div class="verse small">It casts out Pearls upon Pearls on every Shore they lave.'</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>And to cite only one Turkish Authority&mdash;for the Turks claim
Jeláleddín as their own, although a Persian of royal race, born
at Balkh, old Bactra, on the ground of his having sung and died
at Qoniya, in Asia Minor (the Iconium of Paul and Barnabas
and Timothy and St. Thecla), whence he was called Rumi 'the
Roman,' usually rendered 'the Greek,' as wonning within the
confines of old Oriental Rome. This is how Fehîm Efendi, the
Turkish Historian of the Persian Literature, himself a Poet,
begins his Sketch of the Life of the great poetic Mystagogue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="lmargin">

 <p class="small">'As the ideal of Searchers after Truth here below, as the pattern of
 the Pure, the Mevlana is honoured by great and small among the people,
 by the aristocrat and the common man. In all circles his words are held
 in high honour; among all the wise his knowledge is greatly esteemed;
 and no pen has had the power to praise him, and to celebrate his
 excellence worthily, or to describe it in fitting terms.</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse small">And should the fancy hold it can</div>
<div class="verse small indent2">His praise completely reach;</div>
<div class="verse small">Mevlana's praise it ne'er shall scan&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse small indent2">How say it then in speech?'</div>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Rosen, who gives this quotation, and an excellent rhymed
German translation of part of the Mesnevi, refers to that poem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">{xv}</a></span>
as not only 'one of the most celebrated productions of the Persian
Mysticism, but as being regarded by many Mohammedans
as almost equal in holiness to the Koran and the Sunna.'
Being attached, at the time he wrote, to the German Embassy
at Constantinople, Rosen also mentions that not only did the
educated Oriental regard the Mesnevi as the most perfect Book
of Edification, which when its contents were received into his
mind and heart, made him certain of Salvation; but that
even the poor Persian retailers of the products of their
home industries, on the streets, could recite with enthusiasm
long passages from the poems of Jeláleddín. We believe that
this holds true to-day, more or less, of the whole Mohammedan
world.<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>But coming to more familiar names, we might gather a
whole cloud of the most approved witnesses in this connection.
Thus Sir William Jones, the first great Anglo-Indian Scholar,
the Columbus of the new Old World of Sanskrit and Persian
Literature, enters with wonderful sympathy and insight into
possession of the Persian and Hindu Mystical Poetry; he refers
to their great Maulavi, and his astonishing work, <i>The Mesnevi</i>;
and he translates the celebrated opening passage in rhyming
couplets which would not have been unworthy of Pope himself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
Sir William Jones did not, indeed, touch Jeláleddín's Lyrics,
but he rendered some precious morsels of Hafiz, 'Odes,' as they
are called, both in English and French, in a way that made
young European students and poets, like Herder and Goethe,
turn again to the East with yearning expectant eyes. Similar
testimony might be adduced from Henry Thomas Colebrooke,
one of the very greatest of the successors of Sir W. Jones. The
chief Historian of Persia, and the best informed Persian scholar
of his day, Sir John Malcolm (of Langholm), if less sympathetic
than Sir W. Jones in his painstaking account of the Persian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span>
Mystics, gives likewise the first place to Jeláleddín.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
And then much more definitely Sir Gore Ouseley, the first English
Biographer of the Persian Poets, gives Jeláleddín due recognition
in connection with the unrivalled Mesnevi.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>
The Journal of the Asiatic Society, an ever valuable Magazine of Oriental
learning, and the parent of many others of its kind, has been
enriched by the contributions of many enthusiastic English
scholars following in the footsteps of Sir W. Jones, and it
contains the earliest fragments of English translations of Jeláleddín.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span>
Robert Alfred Vaughan, in his <i>Hours with the Mystics</i>,
1856, a popular, sympathetic, and still attractive work, appreciates
Jeláleddín, and compares him with Angelus Silesius and
Emerson, but all his knowledge of the Persian Mystic was
derived from Tholuck and Sir W. Jones. At last competent
scholars began to deal worthily with Jelál's poetry in English.
Sir James W. Redhouse has translated the First Book of the
Mesnevi in rhyming couplets, with the utmost fidelity and care;
and another distinguished Persian scholar, Mr. Whinfield, the
most faithful English translator of Omar Khayyám, has given
an abridged version of the whole immense work, which in the
Persian original contains about 70,000 lines.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span>
The Mesnevi has <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span>
thus come now to be pretty well known by English readers
interested in the subject; and in the last edition of the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>, Professor Hermann Ethé, an unquestionable
authority, in his valuable Articles on Persian Literature
and Jeláleddín Rumi, sums him up as 'the <i>greatest</i> Pantheistic
Writer of <i>all</i> ages,' and speaks of 'his <i>matchless</i> Odes in which
he soars on the wings of a genuine enthusiasm, high over
Earth and Heaven, up to the Throne of Almighty God.' Be it
noted, in passing, that it is at least remarkable how two such
different writers as the Turkish Devlet Shah and the learned
German Orientalist should both write of Jeláleddín in terms
that undesignedly, but irresistibly, recall by their very superlativeness,
the famous lines of Dr. Johnson on Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse quote">'Each change of many-coloured Life he drew,</div>
<div class="verse">Exhausted Worlds and then imagin'd new;</div>
<div class="verse">Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,</div>
<div class="verse">And panting Time toil'd after him in vain.'</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>All this makes it now intelligible that the late lamented Editor
of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, Dr. W. Robertson Smith,
when Professor of Arabic at Cambridge, with the fine insight of
the far-seeing scholar, should have directed the attention of a
young, enthusiastic student to the 'Lyrical Poetry of Jeláleddín
Rumi'; and it is to the loyal devotion of this young scholar
that we owe the first appearance from an English Press of a
Volume of forty-eight 'Selected Poems' of Jeláleddín, in a critical
Persian Text and with accurate and elegant prose renderings.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span>
Mr. Reynold A. Nicholson has thus established a right to
pronounce judgment on the merits of Jeláleddín, and we now
listen to him with deference, and no longer with astonishment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span>
when he deliberately characterises him as 'the <i>greatest</i> Mystical
Poet of <i>any</i> Age.'</p>

<p>As the object of this Introduction is only to determine, in
some measure, the literary interest of the Lyrical Poetry&mdash;the
Díván, as it is technically called&mdash;of Jeláleddín, space need not
be taken up by narrating again what is traditionally known of
his Life, and it is the less necessary as excellent accounts are
now easily accessible. Sir James W. Redhouse gives in somewhat
abridged translation El Eflākī's interesting narrative, with
its romantic wreath of legend, and its quaint anecdotes and racy
sayings. Mr. Nicholson furnishes an excellent summary.
Professor Hermann Ethé's notice in the Encycl. Brit. has been
already referred to, and reference may also be made to his
<i>Morgenländische Studien</i>, and his popular Lecture in the
Virchow-Holtzendorff Series, 1888, on 'The Mystical, Didactic,
and Lyrical Poetry, and the later Literature of the Persians,'
with its fine characterization, which we would fain have quoted.
Rosen translates into German the Biographical Sketches of
Devletshah and Jāmi. Professor E. G. Browne's recent
'Literary History of Persia,' which carries the subject down to
<small>A.D.</small> 1000, and is undoubtedly so far the best History of Persian
Literature yet produced, contains appreciative references to
Jeláleddín, with a masterly account of the Sufi Mysticism; and
we look forward with much interest to a comprehensive and
judicial summing up of the great Mystic Poet, by this high
authority upon the whole subject.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The interest of the writer in Jeláleddín has been from the
first, and all through, philosophical and theological rather than
specially historical or textual. This interest was awakened in
him by Hegel. In early student days, when to him as to so
many then, the Hegelian Philosophy was the all in all of his
thought, he was startled by the unwonted enthusiasm with which
the great thinker at the climax of his severest exposition, paused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">{xix}</a></span>
to pay a warm tribute to 'the <i>excellent</i> Jeláleddín,' when he
came into view in the light of the Supreme Idea of his own System.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span>
This passage in Hegel, seems always to have impressed
the students of his own writings, and it has been
frequently referred to both by his German and English expounders.
The greatest speculative Thinker of the Nineteenth
Century, seems to have felt a deep satisfaction in recognising
the affinity of the greatest speculative Poet of the East to his
own deepest thought, while at the same time carefully distinguishing
the clearer and higher form of his own conception.
Nay more, although parsimonious to the utmost of his space
and words, in this, the most condensed and compacted Text
Book of Philosophy written in any European language since
Aristotle, the stern German Dialectician in a comparatively long
Foot Note, says he 'cannot refrain' from quoting several passages
from the Poet, in order that the reader may get a clearer
knowledge of his ideas; and he quotes them from Rückert's
Versions, to give, at the same time, some specimens of 'the
marvellous Art of the translation.' The Reader who is not
acquainted with German will find Hegel's words accurately
translated by the late Dr. W. Wallace, who also gives an
English version of the passages quoted from Rückert, in
which he says he was 'kindly helped by Miss May Kendall'&mdash;although
Dr. Wallace and Miss May, rhyming in utter
ignorance of Persian Prosody, and consequently, like so many
more, in the dark, have entirely failed to catch the delicate
play of the Gazels, so faithfully reproduced by the tuneful Rückert.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>In another of Hegel's works&mdash;his valuable posthumous
'Lectures on the Philosophy of Art'&mdash;he takes up the same
subject from the æsthetic point of view, and he deals with it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">{xx}</a></span>
again in a more popular, but in an essentially identical, way.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>
As the former passage has now obtained currency in our philosophical
literature, it may be more useful, as well as more
relevant to these pages, to reproduce the latter, the fuller and
more intelligible, but hitherto untranslated, exposition. Hegel
is here dealing with the Symbolical Forms of Art, and in
particular with the symbolism of Sublimity, historically characteristic
of Oriental Art, which thus gives expression to the
consciousness of absolute subordination and the dependence of
all that is individual and finite on the Universal and the Infinite.
In his comprehensive historical survey Hegel, at this stage, finds
occasion to deal with what he calls 'Pantheism in Art.' The
profound thinker, with a vigorous grasp and original view of the
historic evolution, is here singularly lucid and suggestive, as he
delineates the Pantheistic Poetic Idea exhibited in the lyrical
forms of 1. Indian Poetry; 2. Mohammedan Poetry; 3. Christian
Mysticism. Very refreshing and sane is his representation
of Indian Poetry, at a time when the uncritical enthusiasm of
the Schlegels and other young Sanskrit Students, was carrying
an unrestrained admiration beyond all reasonable bounds.
Hegel castigates this juvenile weakness with a firm hand. He,
too, has read the startling translations of the Sakuntala and
the Bhagavad Gita, and he knows something of the Ramayana;
but he is not dazzled or carried away. He recognises the marvellous
exuberance and profusion of the Indian imagination, but
it is all too fantastic as yet. While it is boundless, it is also
formless, and just so far is it lacking in true Beauty. Its
Sublimity is confused, chaotic, helpless; it ever struggles for a
harmonious unity, for spiritual mastery of the manifold and the
overwhelming, which it never attains. All this is truest insight,
soundest criticism.&mdash;But a higher stage is reached in the <i>Persian</i>
Poetry. Here the form of the Poet becomes more adequate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">{xxi}</a></span>
more masterful, more refined. Beauty springing up with
Sublimity, is harmoniously wedded with it, and in one great
Poet the victory of Love is freely consummated; for&mdash;to paraphrase
with Tennyson&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse quote">'For all the past of Time reveals</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A bridal dawn of thunder-peals,</div>
<div class="verse">Wherever Thought hath wedded Fact.'</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>But let us hear Hegel's own grave, well-weighed judgment, as
he spoke it in those days to his own Students at Berlin:</p>

 <div class="lmargin">

 <p class="small">'In a higher and subjectively freer way, the Oriental Pantheism has
 been developed in Mohammedanism, especially by the Persians. A special
 relationship now comes in. The Poet longs to behold the Divine in all
 things, and he actually does so behold it; but he also now surrenders
 his own Self and gives himself up to it, while he at the same time in
 the same degree grasps the Immanence of the Divine in his own inner
 Being, when thus expanded and freed. And thereby there grows in him
 that cheerful inwardness, that free joy, that abounding blessedness
 which is peculiar to the Oriental, who in becoming liberated from his
 own individual limitations, sinks forthwith into the Eternal and
 Absolute, and recognises and feels in everything the Image and the
 Presence of the Divine. Such a consciousness of being permeated by the
 Divine and of a vivified, intoxicated life in God, borders on
 Mysticism. Above all others <span class="smcap">Jeláleddín Rumi</span> is to be
 celebrated in this connection, of whose poetry Rückert has furnished us
 with some of the finest specimens, in which, with his marvellous power
 of expression, he even allows himself to play, in the most skilful and
 free manner, with words and rhymes, as the Persians similarly do. Love
 to God, with whom Man identifies his Self through the most unlimited
 self-surrender, and Whom, as the One, he now beholds in all the realms
 of space, leads him to refer and carry back all and everything to God;
 and this Love here forms the centre which expands on all sides and into
 all regions.'<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13"
 href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">{xxii}</a></span>
Hegel thus deliberately gives Jeláleddín an eminent place not
only among the great Poets, but among the great Thinkers of
the world. He is more than satisfied with Rückert as a
translator, and he is virtually at one with Jeláleddín's principle
of thought. His qualification is historical rather than essential;
the relation to Pantheism is the particular limiting condition of
Jeláleddín's stage of development and environment; it is not a
ground of reproach, nor of condemnation as more than
relatively untrue, or rather incomplete. And so Hegel is at
pains to vindicate the poet-thinker from the vulgar and unjust
stigma commonly implied in the ascription of Pantheism. This
he does in his remarks on the contributions to the subject by
Dr. Tholuck, who became afterwards the eminent evangelical
theologian of Halle, but who was then just entering on his
distinguished career. Tholuck had quite a genius for languages,
and his first intention was to devote himself to Oriental
Philology. He prosecuted the study of Arabic, Persian and
Turkish, with great zeal and success under the distinguished
Dietz; and in 1821, at the age of twenty-two, he qualified as a
University Teacher, by a learned Latin Dissertation on 'Sufism,
or the Pantheistic Theosophy of the Persians.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span>
This remarkable exposition was at once recognised as of real merit, and it
is still valuable. Tholuck, who was a born poet and had a rare
breadth of literary appreciation, supplemented his work, four
years later, by a very interesting Anthology from the Persian
Mystical Poets in German verse, with an attractive introduction
to the whole subject.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span>
With the profoundest admiration for Dr.
Tholuck's work as a theologian, and an unfading personal
affection, kindled by tender and memorable student contact
with him in his old age, we yet cannot dissent from Mr.
Whinfield's critical judgment when he thus sums up the value
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">{xxiii}</a></span>
of these contributions: 'Tholuck was an indifferent Persian
Scholar, and many of his translations are wrong, but he grasped
the meaning of Sufism and its affinity to European mysticism
much more thoroughly than many who were far superior to him
in mere verbal scholarship.' Hegel, who was not a Persian
scholar, is generous in his recognition of Tholuck's Anthology,
but he points out the weakness of Tholuck's criticism, and shews
in particular that the young theologian is too perfunctory in his
view of the subject generally, as merely adopting the 'current
chatter about Pantheism,' and hurling it as a convenient term
of reproach against the whole speculative thought of the time.
This shallow popular criticism, as Hegel puts it, quite misunderstands
the real principle of speculative Pantheism,
confounds it with a crude view of the world which immediately
identifies the object of sense with the Divine, but which no sane
thinker ever really held, and it is to be rejected emphatically
when applied to Jeláleddín. For, as he says, 'In the excellent
Jeláleddín Rumi in particular we find the unity of the soul with
the One set forth, and that unity described as Love; and this
spiritual unity is an exaltation above the finite and common, a
transfiguration of the natural and spiritual in which the
externalism and transitoriness of nature is surmounted: in <i>this</i>
poetry, which soars over all that is external and sensuous, who
would recognise the prosaic ideas current about so-called Pantheism?'
No; Jelál is not to be tabooed, off-hand, and labelled
merely as a Pantheist!</p>

<p>With Hegel's correction of Tholuck and his vindication of
the speculative standpoint of the Persian Poet, we are entirely
agreed; but Hegel is himself here not quite adequate. All
students of philosophy know that in this very relation has lain
the chief ambiguity and weakness of his own System, and it is
reflected in his view of Jeláleddín. With his dominating
passion for systematising the evolution of History and conforming
it to a logical scheme of thought, he yet fails to see&mdash;largely
owing to the limitation of his material&mdash;how practically modern
and how spiritually personal Jelál really is. For, after all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">{xxiv}</a></span>
Jeláleddín is no mere idle dreamy mediaeval Mystic; he <i>is</i>
essentially a modern poet and thinker, and is <i>not</i> to be pushed
back into the dim vagueness and impersonal materialism of
ancient thought. He has twelve centuries of Christian life and
reflection behind him, with all the dogmatic development of the
ancient orthodox Church, on the one hand; all the forms of
Indian pantheistic and Greek freethought on the other; and six
centuries of austere restraining Mohammedan Monotheism as
his central curb and check&mdash;and well and clearly he knows
them all. He is at once universally eclectic and originally
constructive, and he moves freely and joyously with a larger
insight all his own. The East and the West meet in him again,
more richly than they have done in any other for centuries, and
he binds them into a new, happy harmony, the 'heavenly
harmony' of poesy. He is a true Seer, like his own ancient
Zarathustra, like Lao-tse, like Buddha, and much more akin to
Jesus, and Paul, and John, than to the fierce, relentless, one-sided
Prophet of Arabia, whose barren religion he redeems
from its mechanical inhumanity and quickens with the breath
of a purer and Diviner love. His intellectual kinship is with
Plato and the speculative Theologians of the Christian Church,
and with the deep dreamers who live in the highest vision and
lose themselves sweetly and gladly in God. He is the veritable
Morning Star of the new Day of the World, rising in pure
brightness, afar in the East&mdash;and after barbaric crusade and
mad war, heralding, in a clearer and sweeter Song of Divine
Love, the triumph of the new time.</p>

<p>In the year of Jeláleddín's death Edward I. ascended the throne
of England, with the first faltering grasp of a mightier Empire;
the boy Dante was catching the gleam of strange Visions in the
shining eyes of the sweet-faced gentle maiden Beatrice; the
mystic thrill that had run through the Middle Age was pulsing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">{xxv}</a></span>
in the youth of Meister Eckhart, and preparing for Suso and
Ruysbroek and Thomas à Kempis, through the mellifluous
Rhythm of St. Bernard which had been sung for a hundred
years; the Doctor Angelicus had all but summed up the system
of Christian Theology, the well-worn pen just trembling to its fall
from his wearied grasp; and the spirit of Martin Luther, whom
of all religious Reformers Jeláleddín most resembles, was
already beginning to breathe in William Occam and the free
young thinkers of the time. Yes; Jeláleddín has both a wider
relationship and a more modern significance than even Hegel
has thought of.</p>

<p class="gap-above">And now we have surely cited Authorities enough to enable
us to form at least a preliminary judgment, fair, reasonably
informed, and impartial, concerning Jeláleddín's distinctive
position and work as a Poet. We have seen him thrice
crowned&mdash;in the Realms of Poetry. Philosophy, and Religion&mdash;by
authoritative representatives, qualified kingmakers; and
hardly any one who now knows truly of him, will dispute his
right to be ranked as one of 'the great of old! The dead but
sceptred sovrans who still rule our spirits from their urns.'
His royal Title was proclaimed long ago in the musical name
most aptly bestowed upon him when he lived and sang, and
by those who knew him best: <span class="smcap">Jeláleddín</span>, which we have
already rendered literally as 'The Splendour of the Faith,' but
which we prefer now to reproduce in its proper English
equivalent as 'The Glory of Religion.' This designation at
once strikingly expresses the Secret of his Power, the Consecration
of his Genius, and the essence and end of his Humanity.
To him Religion was all in all; it was the very Life-breath of
his Soul; the Home and Joy of his Heart; the be-all and
end-all of his Will. Of but very few others of the Sons of Men
can this be said; of only One can it be said in a higher degree
than of Jeláleddín, as he himself knew and confessed. He too
'sought for the healing Hand of Jesus,' and it purged his inner
sight and enabled him to see all the world again, lying bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">{xxvi}</a></span>
and beautiful, in the Light and Love of God. And moved by
that all-compelling Law whose 'seat is the Bosom of God' and
whose 'voice is the Harmony of the world,' he burst spontaneously
into song, and the keynote of all his singing&mdash;exultant,
jubilant, triumphant&mdash;was ever the living, loving God,
'Him first, Him last, Him without end.' Religion was the
golden Thread on which, all his silvery poetic Pearls were
strung, and he flung them around him in his own generous,
selfless joy, with the most lavish hand. They seem to have cost
him no effort of search or toil. Much more than Spinoza or
Novalis was he a 'God-intoxicated man'; the prophetic fire
burned in his soul, without consuming it and it must out in
'thoughts that breathe and words that burn.' And this is still
our precious inheritance from him to-day, which we will do well
to appreciate and cherish anew in this cold, heartless, irreligious,
prosaic time. Let his ringing voice then be reverently heard
even through these few, faint, far-off re-echoings of his own
soul-stirring elevating strains; for the burden of all he sings, in
endless variation of note and tune, his one theme as he himself
caught it direct from the melody of Nature and of Man, is <span class="smcap">the
Glory of Religion</span>!</p>

<p class="gap-above">This very general Introduction to the subject-matter of Jelál's
Lyrics must here suffice, as our immediate object is merely to
present some specimens of them in a form at once popular and
generally intelligible. But the detail of the subject in its historical,
philosophical and theological bearings, which would
only be confusing here, is reserved for some subsequent discussion.
Sir William Jones gave a first popular Epitome of
the Mystical System of the Persian Poets, which in its own
way has never been surpassed (see Note A), although the
subject has been much more profoundly studied and elucidated
since his time. A competent discussion of the system of 'the
greatest Sufic poet of Persia' (Ethé), would be a valuable contribution
to our contemporary Philosophy of Religion. Mr.
Nicholson has concisely sketched the parallelism between the
doctrines of Jeláleddín and Plotinus, but we must go further
and even deeper than Plotinus in order to reach the root of the
whole matter. Professor Browne is very helpful, and gives the
best Literature, as also does Hughes in his most interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">{xxvii}</a></span>
illustrated Articles; Kremer is invaluable, as also are Professor
Palmer on the one hand, and the recent translators and expounders
of the early Iranian and Hindu Religion and
Philosophy on the other; Whinfield gives an able, lucid Sketch.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Looking now at the <i>poetical form</i> of Jelál's Lyrics, it goes
without saying that it is distinctively Persian, and always
eminently so in its kind. The Persian Poets were truly
'makers'; they not only created most of the nature-imagery
still current in all modern poetry, but they constructed new
forms of rhythm and rhyme, in which they finely echoed the
sweetest melodies of nature and gave a richer and more expressive
music to human speech. Their fluent and flexible
language, with its natural wealth of resonant cadences and
rhymes, furnished them with a facile medium of expression, and
the still richer Arabic readily lent its copious resources at need.
And the Persians were always rhyming, in public and private,
on great themes or small; a poetic people, ever ready to recognise
and honour sweet songsters; the readiest and wittiest of
'improvvisatori.' Even yet, as Richardson tells us; 'it is a
common entertainment for the great and learned men in Persia,
to assemble together, with the view to an exercise of genius, in
the resolving of enigmas ... and to rival one another in the
facility of composing and replying to extempore verses, in
which, from practice and a natural liveliness of fancy, many of
them arrive at an astonishing proficiency.' Hence, as Goethe
says of himself, the Persian Poets 'sang as the birds sing;' and
taking that master-singer of Nature, the Nightingale, as their
model, they too trilled in strains of unrivalled sweetness,
range and depth of tone, and consummate florid beauty. Even
the most careless reader cannot fail to be impressed by the
affluence of imagery in the Persian Lyrical Poetry, and no one
has dwelt more suggestively than Hegel on the spiritual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">{xxviii}</a></span>
significance of its characteristic profusion of metaphors, images,
similes, and comparisons.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span>
But while so lavishly employing the
decorative forms common to all lyrical poetry, the Persian
Poets, with singular constructive originality, also created new
lyrical forms of their own, and carried them to their highest
perfection. Chief of these are the <i>Gazel</i> and the <i>Divan</i>, two
terms which are only now being naturalised in our language,
and becoming generally understood. Here, again, it may be
more serviceable to quote one or two authorities, rather than to
give a mere abstract definition; and as we have generally found
the <i>older</i> authorities in these matters to be the best, we start
with Richardson's summary of the definitions of D'Herbelot
and Revizky.</p>

<div class="lmargin">

 <p class="small">'The Ghazel or Eastern Ode&mdash;says Richardson&mdash;is a species of poem, the
 subject of which is in general <i>Love</i> and <i>Wine</i>,
 interspersed with moral sentiments, and reflections on the virtues and
 vices of mankind. It ought never to consist of less than 5 <i>beits</i>
 or distichs, nor exceed 18, according to D'Herbelot; if the poem is
 less than five, it is then called <i>rabat</i> or quartain; if it is
 more than eighteen, it then assumes the name of <i>kasside</i> or
 elegy. Baron Revizky<span
 class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span>
 says, that all poems of this kind which exceed
 13 <i>beits</i> [couplets], rank with the <i>kasside</i>; and,
 according to Meninski, the ghazel ought never to have more than
 11.&mdash;Every verse in the same <i>ghazel</i> must rhyme with the same
 letter; and when a poet has completed a <i>series</i> of such poems
 (the rhymes of the first class being in <i>alif</i> [a], the second in
 <i>be</i> [b], and so on through the whole alphabet), it is called a
 <i>Divan</i>, and he obtains the title of <i>Hafez</i>, or as the
 Arabians pronounce it, <i>Hafedh</i>.... The <i>ghazel</i> is more
 irregular than the Greek or Latin Ode, one verse having often no
 apparent connection either with the foregoing or subsequent couplets.
 Ghazels were often, says Baron Revizky, written or spoken
 <i>extempore</i> at banquets or public festivities, when the poet,
 after expressing his ideas in one distich, impatient of confinement,
 roved through the regions of fancy, as wine or a luxuriant imagination
 inspired.'<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">{xxix}</a></span>
This is excellent, and thoroughly intelligible. But let us take
from Rückert's most learned work, the more authoritative concise
statement of the 'Heft Kolzum': 'The Ghazel is a poem of
several Beits, which have all one measure and one rhyme.
According to some, there should not be more than 11 Beits,
according to others 12; but some are found having as many as
19.'<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The term Gazel has now secured its place in our great
Dictionaries, and none gives it better than Professor Whitney's
New York 'Century Dictionary': 'Gázel (also Ghazal, Pers.
<i>ghazal</i>, Ar. <i>ghazel</i>, <i>ghazal</i>, a Love Poem). In Persian Poetry,
a form of verse in which the two first lines rime, and for this
rime a new one must be found in the second line of each succeeding
couplet, the alternate line being free.'&mdash;Dr. Murray's
Oxford New English Dictionary defines thus: 'A species of
Oriental lyric poetry, generally of an erotic nature, distinguished
from other forms of Eastern verse by having a limited number
of Stanzas, and by the recurrence of the same rhyme.' And
most concise of all, Funk's Standard Dictionary: 'A Persian
lyric poem, amatory ode, drinking song, or religious hymn,
having alternate verses riming with the first couplet.' 'The
<i>ghazel</i> consists usually of not less than five, or more than fifteen
Couplets, all with the same rhyme.'&mdash;W. R. Alger, Poetry of the
East, p. 66.&mdash;Before leaving the Dictionaries, be it noted briefly,
that the word <i>gházǎl</i> (originally Arabic, and to be distinguished
from <i>gházāl</i>, a young Fawn, <i>our</i> Gazelle, through the French),
derived from a root signifying to <i>spin</i>, means in Persian, a
thing <i>spun</i>, <i>twined</i>, <i>twisted</i>, as out of a thread; and so it designates
an ode, a short poem, a sonnet' (Steingass), 'never
exceeding 18 distichs, nor less than 5, <i>the last line of every
couplet ending with the same Letter in which the first distich
rhymes</i>.' (Richardson's Persian, Arabic and English Dictionary,
<i>s.v.</i>).</p>

<p>All this is surely enough to elucidate the form and structure
of the Persian <i>ghazel</i>, but we may further quote a completing
phrase or two from that conscientious and much lamented
Oriental Scholar, Mr. E. J. W. Gibb, who has treated it most
fully and accurately in his valuable works on Ottoman Poetry.
The Ghazel, he says, is 'the most typically Oriental of all the
verse-forms alike in the careful elaboration of its detail and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">{xxx}</a></span>
its characteristic want of homogeneity. It is a short poem of
not fewer than four and not more than fifteen couplets. Such
at any rate is the theoretical limit, but Ghazels containing a
much larger number of couplets may occasionally be met with;
this, however, is exceptional, from five to ten being the average
number.... If we employ the alphabetical notation usually
adopted when dealing with rhyme sequences, we get the following
for a Ghazel of six couplets: A.A : B.A : C.A : D.A : E.A :
F.A.... In point of style the poem should be faultless; all
imperfect rhymes, uncouth words questionable expressions
must be carefully avoided, and the same rhyme-word ought not
to be repeated. It is the most elegant and highly finished of
all the old poetic forms.... Hence perhaps the extraordinary
popularity of the form.... What the sonnet was to the Italian,
the Ghazel was to the Persians and Turks.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>This will surely suffice to explain the structure and laws of
the Gazel. The Shakesperian Sonnet comes nearest its form
in our poetical versification, and can by comparatively slight
modification be adapted to it. Imagine the final rhyming
couplet of such a sonnet placed first, and the same rhyme
carried on through each of the succeeding couplets in the
alternate even-numbered lines, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, while the other
odd lines (3, 5, etc.) are left unrhymed, and we would have a
regular Gazel which, however, might extend to 18 couplets in
all. Or, taking another familiar instance: let the Quatrain, as
in Fitzgerald's 'Omar Khayyám,' be <i>extended</i> by adding further
couplets (within the limits laid down) to the <i>second</i> couplet, all
corresponding to it in form and rhyme, and the Quatrain passes
into a regular Gazel. The Fifty examples here given are all in
regular form within legitimate variation, and the structure and
rhyme in any of them may be seen at a glance, even in those
with an added recurring refrain in such as were generally
adapted to accompany mystic dancing. Simple as the structure
of the Gazel itself is, it is practically more difficult to construct
it in English than in Persian, from its relative paucity of suitable
rhymes.</p>

<p>To Rückert belongs the unfading distinction of having introduced
the original form of the Ghazel into European Literature.
For this achievement he was particularly qualified by his poetic
gift and his deft power of artistic adaptation. An enthusiastic
and loyal pupil of Von Hammer, he soon surpassed his master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">{xxxi}</a></span>
by the greater accuracy of his scholarship, his finer and deeper
insight, and his unrivalled power of sympathetically reproducing
in German the spirit of Oriental Poetry. His renderings of
certain Gazels of Jeláleddín in 1819 and 1822 are masterpieces
of their kind in the fineness and delicacy of their form, and they
have never been equalled by similar subsequent attempts. The
highest praise that Mr. Nicholson can bestow on the later
excellent contribution in German of other 75 of Jelál's Ghazels
by Von Rosenzweig, the accomplished translator of Hafiz, is
'that we are occasionally reminded of Rückert'; and, strangely
enough, Mr. Nicholson makes no other allusion to Rückert.
Rückert, whose many wonderful feats of this kind not only
from Persian, but from Arabic, Sanskrit, and even Chinese, are
beyond all praise, was quite conscious both of the success and
importance of his effort, as is evident from the four lines on
'The Form of the Gasel' which he prefixed to his Versions of
Jelál's Gasels, which may be rendered thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">The new Form which I first, here in thy Garden plant,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">May, Fatherland, enrich the Garland of thy clime;</div>
<div class="verse">And in my steps may Poets, of happy power ne'er scant,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Sing true in Persian Gazel, as erst in alien rhyme.</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Rückert's example and encouragement have not been ineffective
in German Literature. Besides his own original Gazels
addressed to his distinguished teacher Von Hammer, Platen
with a poetic versatility and elegance of form scarcely inferior
to his own, Paul Heyse, and others have written excellent
German Gazels, and the form is now quite naturalised in
German Literature. But it is still practically an exotic in the
domain of English verse. One of the first and best regular
Gazels in English known to the writer, was done into English
rhyme by Archbishop Trench, who represents it as by
<span class="smcap">Dschelaleddin</span> (<i>sic</i>), but it is really only an imitation of
one of Rückert's Versions. Some of the recent translators
of Hafiz&mdash;especially Mr. H. Bicknell&mdash;have given elegant
translations of some of his Gazels, in proper form.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span>
Mr. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">{xxxii}</a></span>
Nicholson, notwithstanding his disbelief in the adequacy of
English verse-renderings, has given two exemplary specimens in
an Appendix. The Fifty Gazels here presented in English
have been all done after Rückert's versions, of which they are
really renderings&mdash;as indicated on the Title Page. Even when
the translator felt tempted to conform more literally in some
minor details to the Persian original, or fancied he could do so,
he invariably returned to Rückert's form, his admiration for
Rückert's judgment and art having overcome all hesitation.
To Rückert, then, belongs any merit found in these free
imitations of Jeláleddín; to the translator must be attributed
any defect in his attempt to follow, always <i>longo intervallo</i>, the
traces of the footsteps of these two great Masters. Rückert
alone has been able to do justice to the poetic form and thought
of Jeláleddín, and it may be deemed as daring to try to imitate
Rückert as to copy the Original itself. But the attempt, even
where it fails, will be most readily forgiven by the Persian
scholars who best know the difficulties that have to be overcome
on both sides. What is here presented is but a slight endeavour
to popularise, after a holiday excursion into long-loved fields,
their own much more important work, and mayhap to win a
wider, well-deserved interest for it. The child who strays
through the Flower Garden, will, as by irresistible impulse,
pluck some of its fairest blossoms here and there, and if twined
together and offered to the strong hand that cultivated and
reared them, they will hardly fail to be recognised as an offering
of gratitude and affection, and to be accepted with a kindly,
indulgent smile.</p>

<p>It is beautifully related in 'Attar's Biographies of the Sufi
Mystics and Saints,' that the sweet-soul'd, God-absorb'd Rábia&mdash;the
Saint Teresa and Madame Guyon of Persia&mdash;was once
asked: 'Dost thou hate the Devil?' '<i>No!</i>' she replied. And
they asked: 'Why not?' '<i>Because</i>,' said she, '<i>my love to God
leaves me no time to hate him</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span>
We confess, however, that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">{xxxiii}</a></span>
<i>have</i> hated this new-patch'd Omar Khayyám of Mr. Fitzgerald,
and have even at times been tempted to scorn the miserable,
self-deluded, unhealthy fanatics of his Cult. But when we have
looked again into the shining face and the glad eyes of Jeláleddín,
'the Glory of Religion,' our hate has passed into pity and
our scorn into compassion. In the light of that bright Vision
we cannot pause&mdash;we have 'no time' nor inclination for it&mdash;to
deal, as it deserves, with this latest literary craze and delusion.
The Persian Scholars have been amazed, and earnest Critics
who still believe in the spiritual purpose of Poetry, have been
distressed by this infatuation of the young free English mind,
whose issue can only be the humiliation of convicted ignorance,
spurious idolatry, and vain remorseful regret after the mad midnight
debauch. All that is highest and noblest and truest in
manhood is not to be thus wilfully flung away for nothing, or
to be foolishly bartered for the smart Epigrams of the rudest
wit and shallowest reflection. Mr. Fitzgerald by clever tailoring
has indeed clothed his Satan in the well-fitting robes of an
Angel of Light so that he might 'seduce, if it were possible, the
very Elect,'&mdash;but for <i>them</i> all in vain do such 'lean and flashy
songs, grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw.' He has
not hesitated even to eke out his vapid pessimistic song with
verses of his own, and to make his poor old Omar's voice more
cracked, querulous and quavering than it ever really was. And
he has therefore rightly enough separated his Bacchanalian
Rhymster from the holy Choir of the sweet-voiced Persian
Songsters who ever made all the grove vocal with devout praise
of God. Mr. Fitzgerald's Omar&mdash;he himself declares&mdash;is not a
Sufi poet at all; he is but an old tipsy toper, whose drink is
literally and really that of Bacchus; and he drinks&mdash;and
<i>drinks</i>!&mdash;and <i>drinks</i>! till we hear him snore even in broad day,
and till his dimm'd eyes and fuddled brain cannot distinguish
the plainest things even in the clearest light. With Fitzgerald's
hero it is the old, sad story over again; it is <i>drinking&mdash;not deep
thinking at all</i>!&mdash;that has brought him to this. Surely we know
the 'Astronomer Poet' quite well now. M. Nicolas, and still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">{xxxiv}</a></span>
better, Mr. Whinfield, have given us his own Persian Quatrains,
and Mr. Payne has translated them best of all; but
Edward Fitzgerald has turned them into a strange haunting
music of his own, and in his hands the Astronomer Poet
becomes <i>really</i> what our gifted friend Mr. Coulson Kernahan
has so graphically and terribly depicted: A <span class="smcap">Literary Gent</span>,
A Study in Vanity and Dipsomania! Who cares now for his
senile scepticism, his pessimistic whine, his withered cynicism,
his agnostic blindness and despair, his insolent misanthropy, his
impotent blasphemies? We know it all too well; it is only the
work of shattered nerves, a muddled brain, and irreligious self-dissipation.
See how the Astronomer Poet staggers along to
his watch-tower, with that tell-tale nose and flushed brow! How
his trembling hands fumble as he vainly tries to focus the stars!
How his bleared eyes can find neither Zenith nor Azimuth,
Algol nor Aldeboran, nor the Pointers, nor the Pole Star; and
how impudently he swears in his blindness, that he too has
swept through the Heavens and found <i>no God</i>! that man is but
a 'Pot <i>of Clay</i>,' without freedom and without hope! and that all
the World is bitter and hollow and bad! <i>Great Thinker</i>, forsooth!
Well and truly does he himself say that he was 'never
<i>deep</i> in anything but&mdash;<i>Wine</i>'!</p>

<p>But Mr. Fitzgerald protests that while Omar was not a
Mystic, but only a Bacchanalian Poet, and 'that while the Wine
Omar celebrates is simply the Juice of the Grape, he <i>bragged</i>
more than he drank of it.' But this surely is to make him worse
morally than the poor will-broken, self-abandoned drunkard!
Yet after all, the excuse of 'the moderate drinker' is never
quite to be trusted, as Mr. Fitzgerald himself in this case
only too fully proves. The 'Tavern' too is a literal Tavern,
and his very first presentation of his Hero introduces him
to us crying for fresh air at cock-crow, after the night's
carouse, and his kindred thirsty votaries shouting from the
outside to get in:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse quote">'And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before</div>
<div class="verse">The Tavern shouted&mdash;"Open then the Door!"'</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">{xxxv}</a></span>
We soon find that he has only one fixed Article in his Creed&mdash;the
<i>certainty</i> of Annihilation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse quote">'One thing at least is certain&mdash;<i>This</i> Life flies;</div>
<div class="verse">One thing is certain and the rest is Lies;</div>
<div class="verse">The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.'</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>only</i> thing here <i>certain</i> however, is that this, according to
all Persian Prosody, is a <i>bad</i>, illegitimate Quatrain, and Omar
himself would never have rhymed it thus! And notwithstanding
these 'brave words,' it seems almost certain that the poor soul
of the 'Astronomer Poet' did not entirely die out with his last
unsavoury breath; for is there not the strongest <i>internal</i>
evidence&mdash;and pray, mark it well, in these days of the Higher
Criticism&mdash;that it was Omar Redivivus, in an ill-starred, yet
most sincere and loveable Rustic Bard of our own, who sang
gloriously at the same psychological moment, with his own
boon-companions, after seven centuries of world-wide drinking,
again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent2">And aye we'll taste the barley bree!'</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>We are sorry to believe, notwithstanding Mr. Fitzgerald's
rather lame and halting Apology, that it became, more and
more, a confirmed habit; and that 'willy-nilly' the old Nature-tyrant
had it out with him too. Alas! that it should so often be
so with these genial poetic souls-poets, who in their youth
'begin in gladness, and thereof in the end doth come Despondency
and Madness'! In vain does the much-admired Translator
protest; for again he shows poor parched old Khayyám 'by
the Tavern Door <i>agape</i>'!; the Nightingale only pipes to him
'Wine! Wine! Wine!'; his burden of Clay 'with long Oblivion
is gone <i>dry</i>'!; his last hope and only prayer is: 'Ah, with the

Grape my fading Life provide, And <i>wash the Body</i> whence the
Life has died'; and his last word and the final horror is&mdash;'an
<i>empty</i> Glass!' But he is much more candid in his 'cups' than
his ingenious Translator, as all such are wont at a certain stage
to be; for he quite frankly tells us his Rule of Life: 'Drink!&mdash;for
once dead you never shall return!' Nay, he takes us,
in the most friendly way and with irresistible candour, into
his most intimate confidence, and informs us how and when,
and how deliberately, when he found out 'the sorry Scheme
of Things,' his glorified new Creed and boasted new Life
came about:&mdash;</p>

When it could no longer be disputed that the Day <i>was</i>

Rosen, whom I have followed in the last two lines, calls this 'an incomparable
Gazel.' Shems-ud-Din (The Sun of Religion) was Jeláleddín's celebrated
Teacher and revered Master, whose name he introduced into his Gazels
instead of his own, whence his Divan became entitled the 'Divan of Shems of
Tabriz.' Rückert, however, substitutes Jeláleddín's own name, in accordance

<h3><i>A.</i><br />

SIR WILLIAM JONES ON THE MYSTICAL POETRY OF THE PERSIANS.</h3>

<p>1. <i>Epitome of the Mystical System.</i>&mdash;The Persian (and
Hindu) mystical Poets 'concur in believing that the souls of men
differ infinitely in <i>degree</i>, but not at all in <i>kind</i>, from the divine
Spirit, of which they are particles, and in which they will
ultimately be absorbed; that the spirit of God pervades the
universe, always immediately present to his work, and consequently
always in substance; that he alone is perfect benevolence,
perfect truth, perfect beauty; that the love of him alone is real
and genuine love, while that of all other objects is absurd and
illusory; that the beauties of Nature are faint resemblances,
like images in a mirror, of the divine charms; that, from
eternity without beginning to eternity without end, the supreme
benevolence is occupied in bestowing happiness or the means of
attaining it; that men can only attain it by performing their part
of the <i>primal covenant</i> between them and the Creator; that
nothing has a pure absolute existence, but <i>mind</i> or <i>spirit</i>; that
material substances, as the ignorant call them, are no more
than gay <i>pictures</i> presented continually to our minds by the
Sempiternal Artist; that we must beware of attachment to such
phantoms, and attach ourselves exclusively to God, who truly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
exists in us, as we exist solely in him; that we retain, even in
this forlorn state of separation from our beloved, <i>the idea of
heavenly beauty</i>, and <i>the remembrance of our primeval vows</i>;
that sweet music, gentle breezes, fragrant flowers, perpetually
renew the primary <i>idea</i>, refresh our fading memory, and melt us
with tender affections; that we must cherish those affections,
and by abstracting our souls from vanity, that is, from all but
God, approximate to his essence, in our final union with which
will consist our supreme beatitude. From these principles flow
a thousand metaphors and poetical figures, which abound in the
sacred poems of the Persians and Hindus.'</p>

<p>2. <i>The poetical Imagery.</i>&mdash;'Many zealous admirers of Hafiz
insist, that by <i>Wine</i> he invariably means <i>devotion</i>; and they
have gone so far as to compose a Dictionary of Words in the
<i>Language</i>, as they call it, of the Súfis. In that vocabulary
<i>sleep</i> is explained by <i>meditation</i> on the divine perfections, and
<i>perfume</i> by <i>hope</i> of the divine favour; <i>gales</i> are <i>illapses</i> of
grace; <i>kisses</i> and <i>embraces</i>, the <i>raptures</i> of piety; <i>idolaters</i>,
<i>infidels</i>, and <i>libertines</i> are men of the purest <i>religion</i>, and their
<i>idol</i> is the Creator Himself; the <i>tavern</i> is a retired Oratory, and
its <i>keeper</i> a sage instructor; <i>beauty</i> denotes the <i>perfection</i> of the
Supreme Being; <i>tresses</i> are the <i>expansion</i> of his glory; <i>lips</i>,
the hidden mysteries of his essence; <i>down</i> on the cheek, the
world of spirits, who encircle his throne; and a <i>black mole</i>, the
point of indivisible unity; lastly, <i>wantonness</i>, <i>mirth</i>, and
<i>ebriety</i>, mean religious ardour and abstraction from all terrestrial
thoughts.'&mdash;Sir William Jones' <i>Works</i>, vol. iv. pp. 219, 227.</p>

<h3><i>B.</i><br />

HEGEL ON THE CHARACTER OF THE PERSIAN LYRICAL POETRY.</h3>

<p>Continuing the exposition quoted on p. xxi., Hegel goes on to
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>'In Sublimity proper, the best objects and the most splendid
forms are used only as a mere ornament of God, and they serve
to proclaim the magnificence and glory of the One, being
brought before our eyes only to glorify Him as the Lord of all
creatures. But in Pantheism, on the contrary, the Immanence
of the Divine in the objects, raises the mundane, natural, and
human existence itself, to a more substantial glory of its own.
The actual Life of the Spiritual in the phenomena of Nature
and in human relationships, animates and spiritualises them in
themselves, and establishes in turn a special relation of the subjective
feeling and soul of the Poet to the objects of which he sings.
His soul, filled with this living glory, is in itself calm, independent,
free, self-sufficient, spacious, large; and in this affirmative
identity with itself, it expands its life in imagination till it attains
to the same calm unity in the Soul of things. And so it
coalesces with the objects of Nature and their magnificence,
becomes one with the loved one, with the cup-bearer, etc.;&mdash;in
a word, with all that is worthy of praise and of love, and this in
the most blissful and joyous intimacy. The Occidental Romantic
inwardness of Soul shews, indeed, a similar consciousness of
Life in itself; but on the whole&mdash;especially in the North&mdash;it is
more unhappy, is not free, is given to yearning; or it remains
more subjectively shut up in itself, and thereby becomes selfish
and sensitive. Such oppressed, disturbed inner states of mind
are especially expressed in the National Songs of barbarous
peoples. The state of free, joyous inwardness is, on the contrary,
characteristic of the Orientals, especially of the Mohammedan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
Persians, who openly and gladly give up their whole Self to God,
as well as to all that is praiseworthy, yet in this very surrender
preserve their essential free being, which they can maintain even
in relation to the surrounding world. Thus we see in their glow
of passion the most expansive blissfulness and outpouring of
feeling; and with their inexhaustible wealth of brilliant and
magnificent images, through it all there sound the constant
tones of happiness, of beauty, and of joy. When the Oriental
suffers and is unhappy, he accepts it as the immutable decree of
Fate, and in presence of it still remains certain in himself, without
becoming depressed, or feeling sensitive, or despondent, or
distressed. In the poems of Hafiz we find complaining and
repining enough about the loved one, the wine-bringer, etc.; but
even in his Pain he remains as free from care as in his Joy.
Thus he sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse quote2">'"Because the Presence of thy Friend</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Is bright, not sad;</div>
<div class="verse">Burn, like the Taper, out in Woe,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Burn, like the Taper, out in Woe,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>'The taper teaches man to laugh and weep; it laughs in bright
glances through the flame, although it is melting at the same
time in hot tears; even in burning itself out, it sheds a bright
glance around. This is the general character of the whole of
this Poetry.</p>

<p>'To cite some of their more special images: the Persian Poets
speak much of Flowers and Precious Stones, and especially of
the Rose and the Nightingale. It is very common for them to
represent the Nightingale as the "Bridegroom" of the Rose.
This attributing of a Soul to the Rose and of Love to the
Nightingale, occurs frequently in Hafiz. "O Rose," he says,
"while grateful for being the Sultana of Beauty, vouchsafe not
to be proud to the Love of the Nightingale." He speaks himself
of the Nightingale of his own Heart. But when we speak in
our Poetry of Roses, Nightingales, and Wine, it is done in a
quite other and more prosaic sense: the Rose is regarded as for
ornament; we are "crowned with Roses"; or we hear the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
Nightingale and sympathise with it; we drink Wine, and call it
the Dispeller of Care. With the Persian Poets, however, the
Rose is not an image, or a symbol, or a mere ornament; but it
actually appears to the Poet as animated with a Soul, as a
loving Bride; and he penetrates with his spirit deep into the
Soul of the Rose.'</p>

VON HAMMER'S ACCOUNT OF OMAR KHAYYÁM.</h3>

<p>Von Hammer's Account of Omar Khayyám is at once so just,
so discriminating, and so well-informed that it may prove
interesting to our Readers, especially as the work in which it is
contained has become rare; and it may help generally to dispel
some of the hallucination still prevalent about the 'Astronomer-Poet
of Persia':</p>

<p>'Omar Chiam'&mdash;as Von Hammer transliterates the name&mdash;'is
one of the most remarkable Persian Poets; he is unique as
regards the irreligious subject-matter of his Poems, so that, so
far as we know, there is no other found like him in the whole
History of Persian Poetry. He is the Poet of the Freethinkers and
of the Jesters at Religion, and in this respect he may be appropriately
called the Voltaire of Persian Poetry. It is remarkable
too, that in Persia, as elsewhere, Freethinking was the precursor
of Mysticism, and that the Age of the deepest Unbelief
passed over into that of the greatest Superstition.</p>

<p>'Omar Chiam, born at Nishapur, was one of the greatest
Astronomers of his time; he shared the fame of Nassireddin
and Ulugbeg. But Astronomy led him not to the knowledge,
but to the denial, of the Supreme Being; and he embodied the
result of his sceptical meditations in Quatrains, which have
become famous under the title: <i>Rubayat Omar Chiam</i>. In his
youth he was at school with Nisamol-Mulk, who became afterwards
the Grand Vizier of Melekshah, and with Hassan Sabbah,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
the Founder of the Order of the Assassins. In the bloody
prescriptions of his Order, Hassan practically sealed the
doctrinal Unbelief which Omar Chiam proclaimed in his Verses;
and as its Grand master, he sacrificed his old schoolfellow, the
Grand Vizier, to his revenge, because he continued to follow the
path of Right and Virtue. Omar Chiam, as the friend of Hassan
Sabbah, is supposed to have helped him to found his diabolical
Doctrine and his diabolical Society.'</p>

<p>So far Von Hammer. We commend his last statement to
the serious consideration of the amiable Devotees of the new
Red-letter Cult of our fashionable <span class="smcap">Omar Khayyám Societies
and Clubs</span>! The remarks on this subject in our Introduction
apply, of course, only to <i>Fitzgerald's</i> Omar, of whom
he takes a low view&mdash;very pithily summed up by himself in this
phrase: 'the burden of Omar's Song&mdash;if not "Let us eat"&mdash;is
<i>assuredly</i>&mdash;"Let us drink, for To-morrow we die!"' As
regards the <i>real</i> Omar, whom Mr. Fitzgerald did not rightly
understand, our view agrees generally with that of Von
Hammer and M. Nicolas, but it need not be discussed here.
The phenomenal success of Mr. Fitzgerald's Version in recent
years has been largely due to the witchery and glamour of his
Versification. His lasting achievement&mdash;and it is not a small
one&mdash;is to have thoroughly popularised the Quatrain. We now
hear it echoed everywhere, and in all sorts of connections, even
the most trivial. It has recently been applied, with amusing
ingenuity, to the Game of Golf, and even to the translation of
Homer by Mr. Mackail. But the most deliciously ridiculous
thing of the kind in the connection, yet seen, is Baron Corvo's
Translation of M. Nicolas&mdash;'<i>Risum teneatis, Amici?</i>'</p>

<p>These effusions are, after all, only amusing manifestations of
the Omar Khayyám Distemper. It has, however, unhappily
a deeper significance. Mr. Fitzgerald's success has arisen
mainly from his playing into the <i>pessimistic and cynical mood</i>
of the time, and here lies its moral danger, especially to young,
unguarded and unthinking, readers. Let them be assured that
all this is bad thought, bad taste, bad effort. The <i>Byronic</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
mood is not only unhealthy, but is critically antiquated, and
cannot be permanently recalled in any relation whatever.
Better&mdash;much better&mdash;than this is the healthy, if somewhat
rabid, physical progression of Mr. Rudyard Kipling, even to
'ride with the reckless seraphim on the brim of a red-maned
star'! If they will not take it from us, let them listen to the
powerful and earnest words of a lofty, original, spiritual thinker
with which he corrected the kindred morbid tendencies of his
day, and which are again singularly relevant here. Says Professor
Ferrier in a noble and indignant outburst: 'These
aberrations betoken a perverse and prurient play of the
abnormal fancy&mdash;groping for the very holy of holies in kennels
running with the most senseless and God-abandoned abominations.
Our natural superstitions are bad enough; but thus to
make a systematic business of fatuity, imposture, and profanity,
and to imagine, all the while, that we are touching on
the precincts of God's Spiritual Kingdom, is unspeakably
shocking. The horror and disgrace of such proceedings were
never even approached in the darkest days of heathendom and
idolatry. Ye who make shattered nerves and depraved sensations
the interpreters of truth&mdash;ye who inaugurate disease as the
prophet of all wisdom, thus making sin, death, and the devil,
the lords paramount of the creation&mdash;have ye bethought yourselves
of the backward and downward course which ye are
running into the pit of the bestial and the abhorred? Oh, ye
miserable mystics! when will ye know that all God's truths and
all man's blessings lie in the broad health, in the trodden ways,
and in the laughing sunshine of the universe, and that all
intellect, all genius, is merely <i>the power of seeing wonders in
common things</i>!'</p>

<p>With this impressive appeal we pause, for the present. The
standpoint and genius of Jeláleddín could not possibly be
better expressed than in Ferrier's closing words.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
